"74462",":Article","  Laurent Robert Blanc (born 19 November 1965) is a French professional football manager and former player who played as a centre-back, and was most recently the manager of Ligue 1 club Lyon. He has the nickname Le Président, which was given to him following his stint at Marseille in tribute to his leadership skills.[5][6] Blanc played professional football for numerous clubs, including Montpellier, Napoli, Barcelona, Marseille, Inter Milan and Manchester United, often operating in the sweeper position. He is also a former French international, earning 97 caps and scoring 16 international goals. He represented the country in several international tournaments, including the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000, both of which France won. On 28 June 1998, Blanc scored the first golden goal in World Cup history against Paraguay. He began his managerial career at Bordeaux in 2007, winning domestic honours including the 2008–09 Ligue 1 title. After leaving Bordeaux in 2010 he became the manager of the France national team until 2012, replacing Raymond Domenech in the wake of the 2010 FIFA World Cup[7] and leading the country to the quarter-finals of UEFA Euro 2012. In 2013, he was hired by Paris Saint-Germain, winning further honours. After three successful years with Paris Saint-Germain he left the club in June 2016. Following more than six years without coaching in Europe, he was appointed manager by Lyon in October 2022. Blanc was born in Alès, France.[4] His career started at Montpellier, where he signed his first professional contract in 1983. A very technical, yet slow player, he played as an attacking midfielder and helped the club get promoted to Division 1 in 1987. Only a few years later did he settle as a defender following the advice from Michel Mézy, a position in which his physical stature (1.92 m, 86 kg) and his temperament would prove invaluable. His game being perfectly fitted for the French league, he managed to score at least 12 Division 1 goals per season in his last three seasons at Montpellier, for the most part penalties and headers. He also won the Coupe de France in 1990, scoring a goal in the final match. Blanc remains Montpellier's all-time leading goal scorer, with 83 in all competitions (76 altogether in Division 1 and Division 2). On 5 August 2017, Souleymane Camara scored the only goal (in the 59th minute) in Montpellier's Matchday 1 Ligue 1 1–0 win against SM Caen to register his 48th Ligue 1 goal for Montpellier, breaking Blanc's longstanding Montpellier record of 47 Division 1 goals scored in four seasons.[8] In 1991, Blanc tried his luck abroad when he left Montpellier for Napoli in the Italian Serie A. Despite a decent season during which he managed to score six goals, he felt like he could not fully express his potential and returned to France after just one year, to Nîmes and then Saint Étienne, where again he imposed himself as one of the best defenders in the league. Although Blanc scored 13 goals in his last season at Saint-Étienne, les Verts were almost relegated, only staying up because Marseille were not allowed to return to the first division because of the club's financial difficulties. Guy Roux, impressed by Blanc and looking for a replacement for Dutch international Frank Verlaat, convinced him to join Auxerre in 1995. Despite injuring himself early in the season, Blanc came back strongly and played a great part in the team's double that year. Blanc's success at Auxerre drew the attention of several big European clubs. Blanc agreed to join Barcelona in Spain largely because manager Johan Cruyff wanted him and persuaded him to sign. But on the very day that Blanc said yes to Barça, Cruyff was sacked, and Blanc's spell with the club was a less than happy one. Blanc was in the side when Barcelona won the Supercopa de España against Atlético Madrid, but was injured soon afterwards. He played regularly upon his return from injury, but was sent off during the Cup Winners' Cup quarter-final against AIK. He then injured himself again against Extremadura, which forced him to miss the Clásico and the Cup Winners' Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain. After this disappointing season and only one year away from the 1998 World Cup, he decided to leave. Rolland Courbis managed to convince Blanc to join Marseille, which proved beneficial for both the club and Blanc. Blanc quickly became a leader in a team that was desperately lacking confidence, and helped Marseille finish in fourth place in his first season, during which he scored 11 goals and earned the nickname ""Le Président"" (""The President""). The season following the World Cup was both successful and frustrating for Blanc and Marseille, as they finished runners-up in the championship, only one point shy of Bordeaux, and reached the UEFA Cup final, only to lose 3–0 to Parma, with Hernán Crespo intercepting Blanc's back pass to Stéphane Porato to score the opener. Afterwards, Blanc left Marseille for Inter Milan, where he enjoyed some success, winning the Pirata d'Oro (Inter Player of the Year) in 2000. Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson had attempted to lure Blanc several times since 1996 and finally succeeded in August 2001 when, at the age of 35, Blanc was brought in to replace the departing Jaap Stam. He was criticised for poor performances in the early months of his stay at Old Trafford, when United suffered five defeats in the league by 1 December 2001 – with some critics even being keen to point out that the five teams who had beaten them in the league began with the letters which spelt out Blanc's surname – Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle United, and Chelsea. He initially arrived at Old Trafford on a one-year contract, and as his form and his team's form improved throughout the season (although it wasn't enough for United to catch Arsenal in the title race), he was eventually awarded a fresh one-year contract to give him a second season in Manchester. He was nicknamed ""Larry White"" by fans as a loose translation of his name.[9] He scored four goals during his time at Manchester United. One of these came in the league against Tottenham Hotspur,[10] and the other three all came in the Champions League in games against Olympiacos[11] and Boavista (both home[12] and away).[13] Blanc retired from football after helping United win the 2002–03 FA Premier League title.[9] Blanc won the 1988 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, his team beating Greece in the final.[14] He was named the tournament's Golden Player by UEFA.[15] On 7 February 1989, Blanc made his debut for the senior national team against the Republic of Ireland. France, then in reconstruction after the retirement of numerous key players, did not manage to qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Shortly after that, they started an impressive 19-game unbeaten streak, including eight wins out of eight in Euro 1992 qualifying, making them one of the favorites to win the competition. They would, however, get knocked out in the group stage by eventual winners Denmark. After France failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Blanc was heavily criticised, as well the rest of the team, and he subsequently decided to retire from international football. Aimé Jacquet, after taking over the managerial position of the national team, made it one of his priorities to convince Blanc to change his mind. Blanc returned to the team for the Euro 1996 qualification campaign and scored in a 4–0 win over Slovakia. At the tournament finals, he formed a central defensive partnership with Marcel Desailly. Blanc scored France's opening goal in the final group match against Bulgaria in a 3–1 win to put the team into the quarter-finals, where they faced the Netherlands at Anfield. Blanc scored France's winning penalty kick in the shootout after the match had ended 0–0. France then lost on penalty kicks at the semi-final stage after drawing 0–0 with the Czech Republic. However, Blanc again successfully converted his kick. France then entered the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which was held on home soil. Blanc was exemplary during the competition and, on 28 June 1998, scored the first-ever golden goal in World Cup history against Paraguay in the round of 16. In the quarter-final, Blanc helped France to a clean sheet over Italy and scored the winning penalty as Les Bleus prevailed in the shootout. He missed the final after being sent off in the semi-final against Croatia for slapping Slaven Bilić. The sending off was the first (and only) red card of Blanc's international professional career. Despite Blanc's absence, France lifted the World Cup for the first time after defeating Brazil 3–0 at the Stade de France. Blanc was also part of the team that won UEFA Euro 2000 during which, despite having been criticised for his age and lack of speed during the qualifications, he proved reliable in defence and even scored France's first goal of the tournament against Denmark in the group stage. He announced his retirement from international football after the competition, following the example of his captain Didier Deschamps. On 2 September 2000, Blanc, along with Deschamps and Bernard Lama, played his final match for Les Bleus in a friendly against England at the Stade de France.[16] Blanc was well known for kissing good friend and goalkeeper Fabien Barthez's head before the start of every match, supposedly for good luck (the two did repeat this ritual when they played together for Manchester United, but only for Champions League matches). The France national team was unbeaten in all matches when it fielded the World Cup and European Championship winning defence of Blanc, Desailly, Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu.[17] Overall, Blanc recorded 97 caps and scored 16 goals. In 1999, the readers of France Football magazine voted him the fourth-best French player of all time, behind Michel Platini, Zinedine Zidane and Raymond Kopa. On 8 June 2007, Blanc was named the new manager of Bordeaux, replacing Brazilian Ricardo Gomes. For his first season on the bench, he led the club to second place in Ligue 1 and won the Manager of the Year award. His second Ligue 1 season was extremely successful. Bordeaux won the final 11 league matches of the 2008–09 Ligue 1 season, setting a new French record for consecutive wins,[18] to clinch the Ligue 1 title three points clear of Olympique de Marseille. Bordeaux also won the 2008–09 Coupe de la Ligue. Blanc was again nominated for Manager of the Year but lost to Marseille manager Eric Gerets. In the 2009–10 Champions League campaign, Blanc's Bordeaux topped a group featuring Juventus and Bayern Munich without losing a match.[19] After defeating Olympiacos in the Round of 16, they were eliminated by fellow French side Lyon in the quarter-finals. On 16 May 2010, Blanc confirmed his departure from Bordeaux after three seasons in charge of the French outfit. After resigning from his position, Blanc contacted the French Football Federation (FFF) to inquire about the France national team job, which was eventually vacated by Raymond Domenech following the 2010 World Cup. Later that day, FFF President Jean-Pierre Escalettes confirmed that Blanc was a candidate for the position. On 18 May 2010, with Blanc's appointment to the position becoming more probable, Bordeaux chairman Jean-Louis Triaud demanded compensation from the Federation. On 20 May 2010, the club reached an agreement with the FFF for €1.5 million.[20][21] On 26 June, French media confirmed that Blanc had signed a two-year contract with the Federation to lead the team to Euro 2012. The deal was finalised a week later and Blanc was officially named as manager of the team on 2 July.[22][23] As he took charge of France, the Federation had decided to suspend all 23 players who took part in the South African World Cup, much to Blanc's regret.[24] On 11 August, in his first game as manager, France lost 2–1 to Norway at the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo.[25] However, Blanc's team soon managed to top their Euro 2012 qualifying group while also achieving friendly wins over England, Brazil and Germany. France's first match in Group D of Euro 2012 was against England and ended in a 1–1 draw, after Samir Nasri scored to cancel out a goal scored by Joleon Lescott. France then went on to win their second match 2–0 against Ukraine. They advanced to the quarter-finals by finishing in second position in Group D, despite losing to Sweden 2–0 in their final group match. France were defeated 2–0 by the defending champions Spain in the quarter-final match. Blanc stepped down as manager of the national team on 30 June 2012.[26] Blanc was appointed manager of Paris Saint-Germain on 25 June 2013 shortly after previous manager Carlo Ancelotti left for Real Madrid.[27] On 3 August, Blanc won his first trophy with the club, the 2013 Trophée des Champions, defeating Bordeaux 2–1 in the Stade d'Angondjé in Libreville, Gabon, coming from behind with late goals from Hervin Ongenda and Alex.[28] A second item of silverware was won on 19 April 2014, as two goals from Edinson Cavani defeated Lyon 2–1 in the 2014 Coupe de la Ligue Final.[29] PSG's European campaign ended in the quarter-finals of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League with elimination by Chelsea on away goals.[30] On 7 May 2014, after nearest rivals Monaco drew with Guingamp, PSG won the league, despite losing to Rennes later that day in the match in which they celebrated their triumph.[31] The following day, Blanc was given a one-year contract extension to 2016, with club President Nasser Al-Khelaifi saying, ""We are very happy with his results this season, as well as the very attractive football the team has played. We are convinced we will win a lot more trophies together.""[32] Blanc's second season in charge began with victory in the 2014 Trophée des Champions against Guingamp at the Workers' Stadium in Beijing.[33] On 11 April 2015, PSG retained the Coupe de la Ligue with a victory over Bastia in the final, with Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimović scoring two goals each in a 4–0 victory.[34] PSG won the Ligue 1 title for the third consecutive year on 16 May 2015 with a 2–1 victory at Montpellier.[35] On 11 February 2016, Blanc signed a two-year contract extension.[36] PSG reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the fourth consecutive year after dispatching Chelsea in the round of 16, but lost to Manchester City in the quarter-finals. Blanc was criticised by the French media after the Champions League quarterfinal second-leg match against Manchester City, where he had surprised many by having his team play in an untried 5–3–2 formation that backfired completely. On 21 May 2016, PSG defeated Olympique de Marseille 4–2 in the 2016 Coupe de France Final. PSG thus won the Ligue 1–Coupe de France–Coupe de la Ligue domestic treble for the second consecutive season and equalled Olympique de Marseille's all-time record of 10 Coupe de France titles. On 3 June 2016, when asked for his assessment of the season during an interview given to the newspaper Le Parisien, PSG's president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi described the 2015–2016 season as a failure because of PSG's elimination from the Champions League by Manchester City at the quarter-final stage and stated that changes would be made before the following season and a new cycle would begin. On 27 June 2016, PSG announced that Blanc and assistant coach Jean-Louis Gasset had left the club by mutual agreement that ""preserved the interests of both parties"", noting that Blanc had ""left a significant mark on the great history of Paris Saint-Germain"". The French sports daily L'Équipe reported that Blanc would receive a severance deal worth 22 million euros.[37][38][39] On 19 December 2020, Blanc was appointed as the head coach of Qatari club Al-Rayyan, replacing Uruguayan Diego Aguirre.[40] On 13 February 2022, he was terminated because of poor results and replaced by Nicolás Córdova.[41] On 9 October 2022, Blanc was appointed as the manager of French club Lyon. He replaced outgoing Dutch manager Peter Bosz.[42] He was sacked by OL on 8 September 2023, after losing 3 of their 4 opening games leaving them in last place.[43] Montpellier Auxerre Barcelona

She made her England debut at the age of 16, and went on to play in the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup, England's first World Cup appearance. She was also vice-captain of her country. At club level Powell played in four FA Women's Cup finals and captained Croydon to a League and Cup double in 1996. The Football Association (FA) appointed Powell as England's first-ever full-time national coach in 1998. She led the team at the 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2013 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship. After failing to qualify in 2003, she guided England to the quarter-finals of the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2007 and 2011. England's best results, reaching the final of the UEFA Women's Championship in 1984 and 2009, both featured Powell. She was a player at the former and coach at the latter. As well as managing the England senior team, Powell oversaw the whole structure from Under-15s to the Under-23s, a coach mentoring scheme and The FA’s National Player Development Centre at Loughborough University.[1] In May 2009 Powell's administration implemented central contracts, to help players focus on full-time training and playing, without having to fit it around full-time employment. Initially 17 players signed contracts.[2] In 2003 Powell became the first woman to achieve the UEFA Pro Licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Powell made newspaper headlines when FA rules banned her from representing her school team beyond the age of 11. The teacher running the team had appealed against the ban, not, according to Powell, because he was interested in gender equality, but because of a pragmatic desire to field his strongest team.[3] Powell moved on to play club football for Millwall Lionesses when she reached 11. At Millwall Lionesses Powell came under the influence of coach Alan May. A senior manager with British Telecom, May taught Powell people management skills and remained a major inspiration throughout her career, including when she moved into coaching herself. May was employed as Powell's head scout when she became England manager.[4] As the club grew to be one of the most successful in England, Powell left for London rivals Friends of Fulham. A two-year spell with Friends of Fulham culminated in an appearance at the 1989 Women's FA Cup final. Powell scored twice and is reported to have played exceptionally well, but her team were beaten 3–2 by Leasowe Pacific. The match was played at Old Trafford but attracted only 914 spectators, although it was also broadcast on Channel 4.[5] In the aftermath of that defeat Powell returned to Millwall Lionesses, where she became the team's all-time record goalscorer. In 1991 they reached the Women's FA Cup final and beat Doncaster Belles 1–0 at Prenton Park to win the Cup for the first time. Millwall Lionesses also won the Greater London League to qualify for the inaugural National Division in 1991–92.[6][7] The team broke up in the aftermath of that success and Powell moved with teammate Sue Law to form a new club Bromley Borough. Beginning in the South East Counties League, the club quickly progressed through the divisions. After adding England player Brenda Sempare in 1992, Bromley Borough won all 16 matches in the South East Counties League Division One, scoring 142 goals in the process.[8] The team also reached the semi-final of the Women's FA Cup, where they lost 2–0 to treble-winning Arsenal.[9] In 1993–94 Bromley Borough won the National League Division One South by ten points, securing promotion into the top flight of English women's football. Although they were handed a chastening 10–1 defeat by Doncaster Belles in the fifth round of the FA Women's Cup. For 1994–95 the club entered a partnership with Croydon FC and enlisted Powell's England teammate Debbie Bampton as manager. Powell was one of six Croydon players who represented England at the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.[10] With Powell as captain and Bampton as player-manager, Croydon won a domestic double in 1995–96. In the[11] FA Women's Cup final against Liverpool at The Den, Powell equalised Karen Burke's opening goal then scored from the spot as Croydon won a penalty shootout.[12] A farcical end of season fixture backlog saw Croydon play five games in ten days, winning four and drawing one to erode Doncaster Belles' 13-point lead[13] and win the National Premier Division on goal difference.[14] In 1997–98 Croydon lost both domestic Cup finals to Arsenal. The 1998 FA Women's Cup final was lost 3–2 and, despite scoring Croydon's second goal, Powell missed out on her third winners' medal. She had agreed to take over as England coach and retired from playing.[15] Martin Reagan gave Powell her England debut against Republic of Ireland, in a 6–0 Euro qualifying win staged at Elm Park in Reading, Berkshire on 9 September 1983.[16] Aged 17, Powell played in the final of the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football as England were beaten by Sweden on penalties. The two-legged final had seen England recover a one goal deficit at Kenilworth Road in Luton, in muddy conditions described by Powell as ""absolutely shocking.""[17] She was allotted 61 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[18][19] Powell had passed the FA's preliminary coaching award at the age of 19. During her later playing career she had worked as a development officer for Lewisham London Borough Council and in Crystal Palace FC's community outreach scheme. She had also been a volunteer coach at soccer camps in the United States. Ted Copeland encouraged Powell to complete the FA's new female coach mentoring scheme and obtain her 'B' licence while she was still playing.[20] England were unfortunate to be drawn in a 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification group with Norway and Germany, the reigning World and European champions, respectively. Copeland quit as manager after a 1–0 defeat to Germany at The Den in March 1998, which Powell had started.[21] At 31 Powell became the youngest ever coach of any England national football team, as well as the first woman and the first non-white person to hold the office.[22][23] On 26 July 1998 Powell managed England for the first time in a friendly against Sweden at Victoria Road, Dagenham. After entering the game as a substitute, Swedish debutant Malin Moström scored the only goal on 84 minutes.[24] Powell's first competitive fixture in charge was the 2–0 defeat to Norway in Lillestrøm the following month, which consigned England to last place in the group and meant they faced a relegation play-off against Romania. Had England lost they faced being demoted to B level and therefore unable to qualify for major tournaments. Powell described the situation as ""very much do-or-die"" since a substantial reduction in funding was at stake.[25] A 6–2 aggregate victory kept England's place among the elite. In 2003 Powell became the first woman to be awarded the UEFA Pro Licence, studying alongside Stuart Pearce.[1] She had become England coach in 1998, and led the national team to the final of Euro 2009 where they lost to Germany. It was speculated that Powell would become the first female manager in English men's football when she was linked with the vacant managerial role at Grimsby Town in October 2009, however caretaker manager Neil Woods was appointed on a permanent basis.[26] At the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, England suffered a quarter-final penalty shootout defeat to France following a 1–1 draw. Powell controversially attributed ""cowardice"" to the players who had failed to volunteer to take a penalty.[27] After England's disastrous showing at UEFA Women's Euro 2013, there was a clamour for Powell to be sacked. However, despite the first round exit, she retained the support of the FA.[28] In July 2013 Keith Boanas made an outspoken attack on Powell's record as England manager and publicly called on her to resign. As he had also applied for the job in 1998, but was not granted an interview, Boanas suspected that the selection of the relatively unqualified Powell was ""a political appointment to cover all bases"". He criticised Powell's role in the international retirement of his wife Pauline Cope and suggested that anyone could match or surpass Powell's achievements, given a similar level of support.[29] On 20 August 2013, Powell was sacked as manager of the England women's team.[30] On 19 July 2017, Brighton & Hove Albion announced that Powell had been appointed as first-team manager of the club's women's team.[31] On 31 October 2022, Powell stepped down from the role with an 8–0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur being her final match in charge.[32] On 19 May 2023, it was announced that Powell would join the England men's U20s as a technical advisor at the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.[33] On 20 July 2023, Powell was announced as the new Women’s Technical Director at Birmingham City.[34] Powell was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 Birthday Honours for services to association football,[36] and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours for services to sport.[37][38] In 2003, she was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of her talents.[16] Powell was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of East London in 2011.[39] Powell was born and raised in London to a family of Jamaican descent.[40] In 1990 Powell graduated from Brunel University in London with a degree in Sport Science and History.[41] In August, 2010, she was named in 68th place on The Independent newspaper’s annual Pink List of influential LGBT people in the UK.[42] Her entry was subsequently redacted from the online version of the article[why?] and her name was absent from the 2011 and 2012 lists. Powell was included in a rival World Pride Power List compiled by Square Peg Media in association with The Guardian; reaching fifth place in 2011 and 48th place in 2012. Commenting about her relationships with men, she said they were ""intrigued"" to discover that she was a footballer.[43] In an October 2005 interview with Diva magazine, Powell commented about lesbians in football: ""There's always been that stereotyping of female footballers as butch, dykey and unattractive, so maybe it's just best left alone.""[44] Powell's autobiography, Hope: My Life in Football, was published in 2016.[45]","Hope Powell","[""Hope Patricia Powell"",""England"",""women"",""1995 FIFA Women's World Cup"",""footballer"",""manager"",""Powell"",""Bromley Borough"",""World

"74464",":Article","  Pieter Cornelis ""Piet"" Kraak (14 February 1921 – 28 April 1984) was a Dutch football goalkeeper and manager. Known for his ferocity in the penalty area,[2][3] Kraak played most of his senior career for Stormvogels. He also gained 33 caps for the Netherlands national team, including appearances at the 1948 Summer Olympics and 1952 Summer Olympics.[4] After his playing career he worked as a coach, notably at Velox before moving to Denmark where he coached AaB and Holbæk B&I, among others. Born in Alblasserdam, South Holland, Kraak started playing football at VSV from Velsen in 1932. Two years later, he moved to the youth department of their rivals IJ.VV Stormvogels from IJmuiden. He remained a member of that club for twenty years.[1] Kraak made his senior debut as a goalkeeper immediately after World War II for Stormvogels. On 10 March 1946, he made his international debut for the Netherlands national team in their first match after the war. Against Luxembourg, the final score ended in a 6–2 win. In total, Kraak made 33 international caps, two of which were at the 1948 Summer Olympics and one at the 1952 Summer Olympics. After a defeat against Belgium on 19 October 1952, which was mainly attributed to a blunder from Kraak, he was no longer called up.[1] During his active career, Kraak also appeared as a forward for Stormvogels.[5] After being sidelined for several months due to a shoulder injury, he played as a forward in a game against Heracles in January 1954, in which he made a goal and an assist.[1] In 1954, Kraak moved to USV Elinkwijk. Two years later, he decided to retire in order to establish himself as a hotel manager in Zierikzee.[6] In October 1956, however, Kraak returned between the posts at Elinkwijk. After an absence of seven years, he received a call up for the national team again on 4 November 1959 at the age of 38 by national coach Elek Schwartz for a match against Norway, in the absence of Eddy Pieters Graafland and Frans de Munck. This proved to be his final international match. For a long time, Kraak was the oldest player to ever appear for the Netherlands national team, until 1 June 2010, where the record was broken by the then 39-year-old Sander Boschker.[7] Kraak was known as a ferocious goalkeeper, who was a leader on the pitch. Contemporary player Piet Heilig of Stormvogels, said: ""Kraak did not give any instructions, they were commandos"", while journalist Ed van Opzeeland once described: ""Piet Kraak is simply a man who has megaphones where others have vocal cords.""[8] After his football career, Kraak was active as a manager in the Netherlands and Denmark, including at Velox and AaB.[9] He died at the age of 63 in a hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, after having been in a coma for more than two years after a stroke.[10]","Piet Kraak","[""Pieter Cornelis ``Piet'' Kraak"",""team"",""Netherlands"",""manager"",""IJ.VV Stormvogels"",""appearances"",""goalkeeper"",""senior career"",""Dutch"",""caps"",""ferocity"",""penalty area"",""1952 Summer Olympics."",""score"",""caps"",""defeat"",""Denmark"",""1948 Summer Olympics"",""Ed van Opzeeland"",""playing career"",""most"",""others"",""coach"",""youth department"",""rivals"",""member"",""club"",""Piet Heilig"",""career"",""goalkeeper"",""match"",""goal"",""megaphones"",""up."",""hotel manager"",""forward"",""debut"",""debut"",""war"",""forward"",""absence"",""Velox"",""blunder"",""shoulder injury"",""win"",""total"",""game"",""order"",""posts"",""football"",""Holbæk B&I"",""AaB"",""Velsen"",""VSV"",""South Holland"",""Alblasserdam"",""IJmuiden"",""Stormvogels."",""USV Elinkwijk"",""pitch"",""record"",""commandos"",""Elek Schwartz"",""World War II"",""football career"",""manager"",""instructions"",""Belgium"",""two"",""Luxembourg"",""age"",""Heracles"",""Zierikzee."",""others"",""hospital"",""coma"",""cords"",""match"",""Sander Boschker."",""team"",""match"",""absence"",""age"",""Velox"",""call up"",""AaB."",""Copenhagen"",""Frans de Munck"",""Eddy Pieters Graafland"",""Norway"",""3"",""28"",""1948"",""1952"",""1932"",""10 March 1946"",""1948"",""1952"",""19 October 1952"",""January 1954"",""1954"",""October 1956"",""4 November 1959"",""1 June 2010"",""1921"",""14 February 1921"",""1954"",""10"",""4"",""1"",""8"",""5"",""Two"",""14"",""1959"",""1984"",""Two"",""2010"",""two"",""6"",""9"",""1952"",""one"",""1"",""10"",""33"",""19"",""1954"",""1932"",""1952"",""4"",""1948"",""39"",""1"",""38"",""twenty"",""6"",""1"",""1956"",""1952"",""63"",""1948"",""2"",""33"",""2"",""7"",""seven"",""1946"",""two"",""28 April 1984""]","0.0019494826273313672","true","[0.8017601,0.031144446,0.023632554,0.010699046,0.008987425,0.008090521,0.007673538,0.0055411104,0.0050942465,0.004685954,0.004138474,0.004138474,0.003265288,0.0032227838,0.0030166823,0.0026796907,0.002617271,0.0024286672,0.0023463857,0.0020917146,0.0020304697,0.0017766658,0.0017766658,0.0015509119,0.0015509119,0.0015474388,0.0015474388,0.0015073824,0.0014078541,0.0013994097,0.001300563,0.0012917158,0.0012911217,0.0012323706,0.0012013349,0.0011956672,0.0011884938,0.0011862422,0.0011862422,0.0010970111,0.0010945533,0.0010503511,0.0010502313,0.0010502313,0.0010402409,0.0010387346,9.635622E-4,9.624329E-4,9.624329E-4,9.51054E-4,9.225723E-4,9.225723E-4,9.193121E-4,9.193121E-4,9.193121E-4,9.193121E-4,9.167913E-4,8.8215957E-4,7.3229463E-4,7.230282E-4,7.230282E-4,7.224145E-4,7.136358E-4,7.0243713E-4,6.778226E-4,6.31105E-4,6.2468834E-4,6.2068E-4,6.1813125E-4,6.1477284E-4,5.7559187E-4,5.694363E-4,5.6876853E-4,5.547226E-4,5.055362E-4,5.055362E-4,4.9935066E-4,4.881958E-4,4.272404E-4,4.2574128E-4,3.9639007E-4,3.6151448E-4,3.6151448E-4,3.4009645E-4,3.1750495E-4,2.986934E-4,2.986934E-4,1.8757982E-4,1.8757982E-4,1.8757982E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Piet Kraak - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Kraak",,,,,,,

Born in Erechim, Rio Grande do Sul, Neuton joined Gremio's youth setup in 2008, after starting it out at Ypiranga de Erechim. He made his debut for the club on 25 April 2010, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 away victory over Internacional for the Campeonato Gaúcho championship.[1] Neuton made his Série A debut on 8 May, starting in a 0–0 draw at Atlético Goianiense. He scored his first professional goal on 20 November, netting the first in a 3–1 home win against Atlético Paranaense. On 28 July 2011, Neuton joined Serie A side Udinese on a five-year contract.[2][3] He made his debut for the club on 16 August, starting in a 0–1 loss to Arsenal in that season's UEFA Champions League.[4] Neuton made his league debut, on 11 September 2011, coming on as a late substitute in a 2–0 win over Lecce. However, he only appeared in four league games during the campaign. Neuton joined Watford on a season's loan on 31 August 2012.[5] He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat at Bolton Wanderers on 15 September.[6] He subsequently stated that he ""can do much better"" in October,[7] but still appeared in only eight league games in the season. On 2 April 2014 Neuton joined newly promoted side Chapecoense on loan until December.[8] Mainly a backup to Douglas Grolli and Jailton, he was only utilized in nine matches before being released in November.[9] On 31 August 2015 Neuton was loaned to La Liga side Granada CF, for one year.[10] On 1 February of the following year, after making no league appearances, he joined Albacete Balompié on loan until June.[11] In September 2016, Neuton signed with Italian third-tier club Pistoiese.[12] On 31 August 2017, he switched clubs and countries and moved to Cypriot club Doxa Katokopias.[13] On 5 April 2018, he returned to his native country and signed with second-tier club Juventude.[14]","Neuton","[""Neuton Sérgio Piccoli"",""debut"",""Ypiranga"",""Brazilian"",""back"",""defender"",""Ypiranga de Erechim"",""youth setup"",""Sul"",""Rio Grande"",""Gremio"",""club"",""debut"",""club"",""victory"",""league debut"",""debut"",""season"",""side"",""season"",""loan"",""win"",""first"",""home win"",""Pistoiese."",""campaign"",""league games"",""defeat"",""substitute"",""loss"",""draw"",""Campeonato Gaúcho championship."",""Série A"",""goal"",""Internacional"",""loan"",""side"",""UEFA Champions League."",""league appearances"",""club"",""club"",""clubs"",""September."",""Lecce"",""Arsenal"",""Atlético Goianiense"",""Atlético Paranaense"",""country"",""countries"",""Bolton Wanderers"",""Udinese"",""November."",""Watford"",""La Liga"",""Granada CF"",""season"",""loan"",""June."",""league games"",""backup"",""Albacete Balompié"",""matches"",""Italian"",""Doxa Katokopias."",""Cypriot"",""Juventude."",""Jailton"",""Douglas Grolli"",""December."",""Chapecoense"",""2008"",""2011"",""25 April 2010"",""8 May"",""20 November"",""28 July 2011"",""16 August"",""11 September 2011"",""31 August 2012"",""15 September"",""2 April 2014"",""31 August 2015"",""1 February"",""September 2016"",""31 August 2017"",""5 April 2018"",""nine"",""3"",""10"",""2016"",""13"",""2"",""2010"",""14"",""eight"",""15"",""1"",""4"",""0"",""0"",""2014"",""2017"",""5"",""7"",""1990"",""2008"",""2"",""2"",""one"",""31"",""1"",""five"",""2018"",""9"",""90"",""2015"",""2"",""8"",""2012"",""6"",""11"",""0"",""1"",""5"",""8"",""0"",""1"",""14"",""2011"",""12"",""3"",""four"",""0"",""31"",""11"",""31"",""28"",""2"",""1"",""25"",""16"",""20"",""14 March 1990""]","0.001815304004677285","true","[0.7245504,0.02226747,0.017294686,0.015207207,0.014061377,0.013555265,0.010843546,0.010363571,0.009198507,0.008292792,0.0072871842,0.006940031,0.0066070105,0.004719721,0.0046525784,0.004492963,0.0041081263,0.003947068,0.0038988558,0.00360889,0.00360889,0.0036003806,0.0035643736,0.0035643736,0.0034207208,0.003297258,0.003297258,0.0032918493,0.0031627337,0.0031627337,0.0031396982,0.0031321906,0.0031321906,0.0031310958,0.0027513634,0.0027159855,0.0027159855,0.0026568717,0.002522097,0.002273719,0.002273719,0.002273719,0.0021336328,0.0018696588,0.0018696588,0.0018560311,0.0018509419,0.0017338903,0.0017338903,0.0017092921,0.0015545227,0.001464207,0.0014387632,0.0012860292,0.0012860292,0.0011926561,0.0011909282,0.001165424,0.0010877465,0.0010861704,0.0010824477,9.5396984E-4,8.9992845E-4,8.9992845E-4,8.9992845E-4,8.9992845E-4,5.6364463E-4,5.6364463E-4,5.6364463E-4,4.7438667E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Neuton - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuton",,,,,,,
"74467",":Article","  Wahbi Khazri (Arabic: وهبي خزري; born 8 February 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder, left winger or forward for Ligue 1 club Montpellier. Trained at Bastia from 2004, Khazri made his professional debut there in 2009 and quickly became a vital part of the team, as he helped the club reach promotion to Ligue 2 in 2011, and then Ligue 1 in 2012. He left in 2014 to join fellow French side Bordeaux. In 2016, Khazri joined Sunderland in the Premier League; he was subsequently loaned to Rennes during the 2017–18 campaign. After finishing the season with 11 goals in 29 games, Khazri attracted the attention of Saint-Étienne, who recruited him in July 2018. In 2022, Khazri signed for Montpellier. Born in France, Khazri represented his birth country at youth international level, and Tunisia at senior international level. He was the former captain of the national team, playing 74 matches and scoring 25 goals for the side between 2013 and 2022. He represented Tunisia at five Africa Cup of Nations tournaments and at both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup. A native of Ajaccio, Khazri started his career with local side Jeunesse Sportive Ajaccio before moving to Bastia. He received his first call up to the senior squad for their match against Amiens on 20 February 2009.[4] He made his debut in that match coming on as a substitute in the 85th minute for Ludovic Genest. Bastia scored the winning goal a minute later to win the match 1–0.[5] He scored his first career goal on 13 March 2009, in a 1–0 victory over Montpellier.[6] Wahbi quickly established himself as a goalscorer, scoring again a couple of weeks later in a 3–1 win over Vannes.[7] He scored again, this time on the final match day of the season against Troyes, scoring the first goal in a 2–1 victory.[8] The loss meant Troyes would be relegated to the Championnat National.[citation needed] On 1 July 2014, he signed up for four years with the Bordeaux.[9] He played his first match in his new colors on 9 August 2014, on the first day of the 2014–15 season against Montpellier. Bordeaux won by a goal to zero that day. He scored his first goal in his second appearance for Bordeaux, the next day as the Girondins host Monaco on 17 August. He scored his goal on a penalty that he himself caused and thus participated in the victory of his family 4–1.[citation needed] On 28 September 2014, he scored the 3,400th goal in Girondins history. His first season at the Girondins was a success: he managed to win in the team as a starter and totaled nine goals in 32 league games.[10] He scored his first goal of the 2015–16 season, in his first match against Reims on 9 August 2015 (defeated by a score of 2–1). On 11 September, he scored a goal in a high-tension match for championship leaders Paris Saint-Germain (PSG); he managed to take the ball from the feet of Kevin Trapp, the opposing goalkeeper, even if the match ended in a 2–2 draw.[11] On 30 January 2016, Khazri joined Sunderland on a four and a half-year contract for an undisclosed fee.[12] Khazri scored his first goal for Sunderland against Manchester United on 13 February 2016, opening the scoring with a direct free kick that beat David de Gea at his far post. Khazri later set up Lamine Koné's 82nd-minute goal from a corner, as Sunderland won 2–1.[citation needed] On 7 May 2016, Khazri scored a volley in a 3–2 win over Chelsea as manager Sam Allardyce's team neared survival in the Premier League. Richard Mennear of the Sunderland Echo wrote that ""His work rate was immense, pressing and probing the Chelsea defence and causing problems from set pieces. He has regained his form just at the right time"".[13] On 31 August 2017, Khazri returned to Ligue 1, signing a season-long loan at Rennes.[14] He was sent off on 14 October in a 2–0 Derby Breton loss at Guingamp, earning two yellow cards for dissent within ten seconds.[15] His nine goals helped the club to 5th place and qualification to the Europa League.[16] On 17 July 2018, Khazri transferred to Saint-Étienne for four years and chose to wear number 10.[17] He played his first match with the “Greens” on the first day of Ligue 1, 11 August against Guingamp at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard,[18] and it was on that day that he also scored his first goal in his new colors. He opened the scoring by performing a volley after a cross from the left of Loïs Diony. ASSE wins 2–1 in this game.[19] On 28 September, on behalf of the eighth day of Ligue 1, he achieved a performance at home against Monaco,[20] scoring the only two goals of the match, thus achieving his first double with Saint-Étienne.[21] On 12 January 2019, while ASSE traveled to the Stade de Roudourou to once again face Guingamp, Wahbi Khazri scored the only goal of the match on a direct free kick at ground level, deceiving the opposing goalkeeper Marc-Aurèle Caillard. This achievement allows him to bring his total of goals to ten units, a score he had never achieved before in a single season in the league. His second half of the season was less brilliant but he still ended the 2018–19 season with thirteen goals scored, making him the top scorer for his team in this exercise.[citation needed] Khazri had a difficult start to the 2019–20 season. If he is decisive passer for Romain Hamouma during the victory in Dijon 1–2, it is not until the eleventh day, 27 October against Amiens, to see him score his first goal of the season, not sufficient however to obtain the victory 2–2. Khazri, who then gets injured with his selection in November, is out for several weeks.[22] Due to the state of the club's finances, he was placed on the unwanted list by Claude Puel during the 2020–21 season.[23] However, despite contacts at Turkish runner-up Trabzonspor,[24] the club failed to sell him. He is therefore reinstated in the group with a first match against Lens, where he takes a red card after a late tackle.[25] He scored his first goal of the season from the penalty spot against Lille 1–1 on 29 November. His playing time is reduced compared to previous seasons, but through perseverance he manages to regain his starting position and even scores the first hat-trick of his career in the victory 4–1 against Bordeaux on 11 April 2021.[26] This match also allows him to reach the symbolic bar of 200 matches in Ligue 1.[27] During the 2021–22 season, on 30 October, during a trip to face Metz, he scored his seventh goal of the season in Ligue 1 with a shot from 68 meters, the furthest goal in Ligue 1 since 2006, the first year in which the distances of shots were measured.[28] After the eviction of Claude Puel as manager, interim coach Julien Sablé entrusted the captain's armband to Khazri. He continued his role as captain under new coach Pascal Dupraz.[29] On 27 June 2022, Khazri signed for Ligue 1 side Montpellier. He chose the number 99 jersey at the club, becoming the first player to wear the number for Montpellier.[30] On 13 August 2022, he scored his first goal for the club in 5–2 away loss to Paris Saint-Germain.[31] In 2009, Khazri made his debut for the Tunisia national under-20 football team.[32] However, in November 2011, he was called up by Erick Mombaerts to the France national under-21 football team for a pair of 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifiers against Romania and Slovakia.[33] In February 2012, he played his first and only game for the French side, against Italy, before being substituted by Frédéric Bulot.[34] In late 2012, Khazri switched his international allegiance once again, when he accepted a call-up from Sami Trabelsi, the Tunisian national team's coach, including him in the squad for the 2013 African Cup of Nations.[35] Henryk Kasperczak named Khazri among 23 Tunisians to compete at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.[36] In the final group game, a 4–2 win over Zimbabwe at the Stade d'Angondjé, he assisted Naïm Sliti and scored a penalty in a 4–2 win that put the Carthage Eagles through at the expense of a favoured Algeria side.[37] Manager Nabil Maâloul called up Khazri for Tunisia's squad at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[38] In the second group match, he assisted Dylan Bronn and scored himself in added time in a 5–2 loss to Belgium in Moscow.[39] With both teams already eliminated, he then played his part in a 2–1 comeback win over Panama that was Tunisia's first at the World Cup since 1978; he set up Fakhreddine Ben Youssef and then scored the winning goal, the 2,500th in the competition's history.[40] Khazri was the captain of the Tunisian side that came fourth at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

"74468",":Article","  Alexandre ""Álex"" Geijo Pazos (born 11 March 1982) is a former footballer who played as a striker.[1] He amassed Segunda División totals of 216 matches and 70 goals over seven seasons, representing five clubs in the process. He added eight goals from 90 appearances in La Liga, with Málaga, Levante, Racing de Santander and Granada, and also competed professionally in his birth nation of Switzerland, Italy (all three major levels) and England. The son of Spaniards who immigrated to Switzerland, Geijo was born in Geneva.[2] He started his professional career in his country of birth with Neuchâtel Xamax FCS in 2000, moving the following year to Spain where he began playing with Málaga CF, with little individual success (15 matches in three seasons, playing mostly for the reserves), being released in summer 2005.[3] For the next two years, Geijo played in the Segunda División with another Andalusian club, Xerez CD, where he blossomed into a useful attacking player, scoring 13 goals in his first season.[4] For the 2007–08 campaign, he joined Levante UD:[5] in a team severely hindered by financial problems, and eventually relegated from La Liga, he finished as the second team goal scorer at five, behind Mustapha Riga's eight.[6] Geijo started his second year strong, netting ten second-tier goals before the end of 2008. However, he missed the remainder of the season due to a serious fibula injury, after an awkward fall in a training session.[7] On 28 July 2009, Geijo joined Racing de Santander for four years; still recovering from injury, he nonetheless completed a successful medical.[8] His only goal only arrived on 24 January 2010, but it was a crucial one, as the Cantabrians beat Sporting de Gijón away by a single goal.[9][3] However, on 1 February, he signed with Udinese Calcio, rejoining former Levante coach Gianni De Biasi.[10] In July 2010, inserted in a partnership between Granada CF and Udinese, Geijo was loaned by the Italians in a season-long move.[11] On 30 October he put three past former team Xerez in a 5–0 home win[12] and, on 13 November, he scored all of his team's goals in a 4–1 home victory over FC Barcelona B.[13] He finished the campaign with 24 goals (fourth-best in the competition) and his team achieved a second consecutive promotion, reaching the top flight after 35 years.[14] Geijo started 2011–12 injured, with Granada languishing in the table's bottom three for most of the first months.[15][16] On 31 October 2011 he scored his first goal of the campaign, equalising an eventual 2–1 away defeat of Sevilla FC in a local derby.[17] On 9 August 2012, Geijo joined Football League Championship club Watford on a season-long loan.[18][19] He scored his first goal on 27 November, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–1 win at Sheffield Wednesday.[20] Geijo only scored once for Udinese in the Serie A, in the 2–2 away draw with U.C. Sampdoria on 21 December 2014.[21] He remained in the country subsequently, with Brescia Calcio in the Serie B[22] and Venezia F.C. in the Serie C, winning promotion with the latter in 2017.[23][24] Geijo retired in August 2021 at the age of 39, after two seasons in his country's Segunda División B with Atlético Sanluqueño CF.[25]","Alex Geijo","[""Alexandre ``Álex'' Geijo Pazos"",""goals"",""goal"",""seasons"",""matches"",""clubs"",""striker."",""totals"",""process"",""goals"",""Segunda División"",""Spain"",""campaign"",""levels"",""appearances"",""birth nation"",""son"",""Switzerland"",""club"",""Levante"",""Italy"",""Málaga"",""England"",""La Liga"",""Gianni De Biasi."",""country"",""goals"",""goals"",""Granada"",""birth"",""matches"",""Racing de Santander"",""season"",""reserves"",""success"",""career"",""team"",""campaign"",""goal"",""goal"",""injury"",""fibula injury"",""Udinese Calcio"",""medical."",""Cantabrians"",""home win"",""training session."",""remainder"",""fall"",""goal scorer"",""problems"",""player"",""Málaga CF"",""partnership"",""Spaniards"",""Neuchâtel Xamax"",""Geneva."",""FCS"",""club"",""win"",""seasons"",""derby."",""defeat"",""Italians"",""country"",""country"",""Mustapha Riga"",""Xerez CD"",""Andalusian"",""goals"",""goals"",""promotion"",""Levante UD"",""age"",""latter"",""Sevilla FC"",""team"",""team"",""Football League Championship"",""Sheffield"",""Sporting de Gijón"",""Sampdoria"",""promotion"",""all"",""Watford"",""Segunda División B"",""Serie B"",""Brescia Calcio"",""most"",""months."",""table"",""flight"",""competition"",""home victory"",""U.C."",""Serie A"",""Venezia F.C."",""Serie C"",""Atlético Sanluqueño CF."",""FC Barcelona B."",""2000"",""2014"",""2005"",""2007"",""2008"",""28 July 2009"",""24 January 2010"",""1 February"",""July 2010"",""30 October"",""13 November"",""2011"",""31 October 2011"",""9 August 2012"",""27 November"",""21 December 2014"",""2017"",""August 2021"",""two"",""5"",""2010"",""15"",""39"",""five"",""2005"",""08"",""7"",""28"",""2010"",""24"",""1"",""2008"",""35"",""15"",""2"",""25"",""1"",""eight"",""2009"",""9"",""13"",""1"",""30"",""70"",""11"",""19"",""1"",""seven"",""2007"",""four"",""18"",""24"",""17"",""three"",""20"",""3"",""24"",""216"",""3"",""1"",""2011"",""2012"",""2017"",""6"",""10"",""23"",""2011"",""2000"",""three"",""21"",""4"",""5"",""three"",""2"",""eight"",""90"",""16"",""27"",""2"",""2021"",""90"",""11"",""two"",""4"",""five"",""2"",""three"",""21"",""13"",""9"",""1982"",""12"",""0"",""12"",""14"",""ten"",""31"",""8"",""22"",""4"",""13"",""one"",""11 March 1982""]","0.0023567864149243016","true","[0.52418035,0.033030726,0.032313783,0.029068744,0.021318952,0.019690396,0.018747913,0.018747913,0.018747913,0.01597575,0.013862547,0.01034255,0.009337882,0.009032605,0.009032605,0.009032605,0.00868358,0.007960562,0.0073152455,0.006670049,0.006084807,0.006084807,0.0053458475,0.0050542997,0.0047760974,0.0042511714,0.0041257665,0.004075363,0.0039762775,0.003877739,0.003877739,0.0038097699,0.003611475,0.0034063393,0.0034063393,0.0034063393,0.00326541,0.0028683376,0.0028351243,0.0028351243,0.0026392366,0.0026392366,0.0026084674,0.0025579806,0.0024732915,0.002421473,0.0023182153,0.0023182153,0.0023182153,0.0022979875,0.0022979875,0.0022979875,0.002292489,0.0021269098,0.0020136,0.0020136,0.0020136,0.0020136,0.001995048,0.0018196114,0.0017390253,0.0015982019,0.0015982019,0.001431114,0.0013930694,0.0013930694,0.0013580975,0.0013580975,0.0013580975,0.0012465073,0.0012465073,0.001224468,0.0011430989,0.001115897,0.001115897,0.001075271,9.984806E-4,9.984806E-4,9.443882E-4,9.443882E-4,8.372817E-4,8.128467E-4,7.9978514E-4,7.9978514E-4,7.948564E-4,7.507146E-4,7.507146E-4,7.507146E-4,7.0242246E-4,7.0242246E-4,7.0242246E-4,7.0242246E-4,7.0242246E-4,7.0242246E-4,6.608055E-4,6.608055E-4,6.593236E-4,6.593236E-4,6.593236E-4,4.1498736E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Alexandre Geijo - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Geijo",,,,,,,
"74469",":Article","  Almen Abdi (born 21 October 1986[3]) is a retired Swiss footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He has previously played for Zürich, Le Mans, Udinese, Watford and Sheffield Wednesday. He has also been capped by the Switzerland national team. Abdi started his football career at Zürich, where he joined the youth academy in 1993 and came through the ranks.[4] He made his professional debut at age seventeen in the 2003–04 season, coming on as a substitute for Arthur Petrosyan in the 89th minute, in a 2–1 loss against Basel. Throughout his first three seasons at Zürich, Abdi featured little, and mostly remained a bench player. However, the 2006–07 season was Abdi's breakthrough season, making more appearances than ever and establishing himself as a first team starter. During the 2006–07 season, Abdi would make his Champions League debut in the second qualification round against Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg, after coming on as a substitute. He scored his first league goal on 29 July 2006, in a 2–0 win over Schaffhausen. Abdi was part of the 2005–06, 2006–07 and 2008–09 Swiss Championship winning Zürich squad. He was awarded an improved contract in June 2006 which would last until the summer of 2010[citation needed]. Having finished as the club's top goalscorer in the 2008–09 league campaign with 19 goals and adding an impressive 12 assists, Abdi was not only named the best midfielder in the Swiss Super League,[5] but also presented with the season's Best Swiss Player Award.[6] In the 2009–10 season, Abdi was dropped to the FC Zürich reserve team in November 2009, alongside teammate Andrés Vasquez, with FC Zürich stating they were planning for the future without the duo.[7][8] In January 2010, Abdi was transferred to Le Mans on a six-month contract with the option to extend it at a later date, should the club remain in Ligue 1.[9][10] However, Le Mans failed to avoid relegation to Ligue 2 at the end of the campaign, with Abdi making a total of 13 appearances. In April 2010, Abdi confirmed that he would be joining Udinese in the summer once he became a free agent.[11] In Udine, he made 19 appearances during the 2010–11 season, most of them coming from the bench. The following campaign saw Abdi score his first goal for the Friulian club in the Europa League on 29 September 2011, converting the penalty to equalise against Celtic at Celtic Park.[12] Shortly after, there was a rumour of Abdi making a return to Zürich.[13] But Abdi denied any rumour of him being linked to Zürich, insisting he felt fine and settled at Udinese.[14] In July 2012, Abdi trained with Watford with a view to a possible loan. He featured in the Championship side's first three pre-season friendlies,[15] and later joined the club on a season-long loan for the 2012–13.[16] Abdi scored his first goal for Watford on his league debut against Crystal Palace on 18 August 2012.[17] In November 2012, Abdi soon injured his shoulder, dislocating it in the process.[18] Following four weeks of regeneration, he returned to the bench and came on as a substitute during the 2–1 home loss against Hull City on 8 December 2012. Abdi made it three league goals in as many games with his effort against Birmingham City on 16 February 2013, taking his total goal tally to 9. Abdi had netted in the previous two games against Bolton Wanderers and Crystal Palace. Abdi then scored his 10th goal of the season with a sumptuous free kick in a 1–1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers on 1 March 2013. Towards the end of the season, Abdi reportedly stated his desire to remain at Watford on a permanent basis, having become the club's fan favorite.[19] In early May 2013, he picked up the Hornets' Player of the Season award.[20] On 19 July 2013, Watford confirmed that Abdi had signed a three-year deal on a permanent basis.[21] In August 2013, he developed a severe case of plantar fasciitis (a foot disease), which kept him out of action for several months.[22] Abdi made his long-awaited comeback as a 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 FA Cup third round replay victory over Bristol City on 14 January 2014. Abdi then made his league return four days later, as a first-half substitute against AFC Bournemouth on 18 January 2014, coming on for the injured Iriney. Making his first league start for seven months, Abdi scored for Watford in a 3–0 home win over Leeds United on 8 April 2014. On 30 August 2014, Abdi scored his first ever brace for the club at Vicarage Road as Watford beat Huddersfield Town 4–2, with Abdi providing the goals to make it 2–1 and 4–2 respectively as well as registering an assist in the same game.[23] On 28 July 2016, Abdi joined Championship side Sheffield Wednesday for an undisclosed fee.[24] He was released by Sheffield Wednesday at the end of the 2018–19 season.[25] He made his senior Switzerland international debut against Cyprus on 20 August 2008. On 24 April 2011, Abdi was targeted by burglars and his possessions were stolen.[26] He is good friends with compatriot and ex-Udinese teammate Gökhan Inler.[27] FC Zürich","Almen Abdi","[""Almen

"74470",":Article","  Christopher Robert Iwelumo (/ɪˈwɛləmoʊ/;[2] born 1 August 1978) is a Scottish former professional footballer, who played as a striker. Iwelumo started his career with St Mirren before moving to Danish club Aarhus Fremad for two years. A move to Stoke City in 2000 saw him sent out on loan to several teams before a short-lived spell with 2. Fußball-Bundesliga side Alemannia Aachen. After moving to the Football League Championship with Colchester United and then Charlton Athletic, he signed for Wolves in 2008 as they won promotion to the Premier League, winning Player of the Month in November 2008. Iwelumo's father is Nigerian and his mother is Scottish. He won his first cap as a full Scottish international coming on as a substitute against Norway in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier in 2008, notable for his missing an open goal from only yards out as the match finished 0–0 an event which Iwelumo has said ""tortured"" him. He had his first international start in a friendly against Argentina in November the same year. Born in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire to a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother, Iwelumo started his career with Scottish Football League club St Mirren as a junior in their youth system before signing a professional contract on 5 August 1996.[1][3] Iwelumo had only made nineteen appearances for St Mirren, scoring twice against Berwick in the Scottish League Cup[4] and Dundee in the Scottish Cup,[5] before his performances were being noticed and in early 1998, Aarhus Fremad of Denmark signed him up. Aarhus released him two years later in February 2000 and he had trials at Preston North End and Celtic – the team he supports – before signing a four-year deal with Stoke City.[6] After two years in Denmark, Iwelumo returned to the UK to join third tier Stoke City. He played as a substitute as Stoke won the 2000 Football League Trophy Final.[7] Later that year he was sent out on loan to York City where he made eleven appearances before returning to Stoke. He remained there before being loaned out again to Cheltenham Town in February 2001. He played four times for Cheltenham Town, scoring once against Mansfield[8] before being recalled back from his loan by Stoke City where he managed to build on his appearances without actually gaining a regular place in the first team, his most notable contribution possibly being the equaliser in the Potteries derby on 21 October 2001. He signed a two-year contract extension with Stoke in March 2002.[9] Barnsley revealed an interest in signing Iwelumo in January 2004.[10] He was subject of a loan move once more when he moved to Brighton & Hove Albion in March 2004.[11] He helped the ""Seagulls"" to the 2004 Second Division play-off final in Cardiff, winning the penalty that gave Albion promotion.[12] When he returned to Stoke at the end of the season he was released, after four years at the club. 2. Fußball-Bundesliga side Alemannia Aachen signed Iwelumo on a free transfer in July 2004, after rejecting the offer of a two-year contract from Brighton.[13] However his stay at Aachen was short-lived, and he was released after just six months and nine substitute appearances. Iwelumo had his most successful period of his career at Colchester United, he signed for Colchester United in July 2005.[14] On 28 November 2006, the many highlights included, the four goals he scored as Colchester beat Hull City 5–1 in a Championship league match.[15] Iwelumo formed a formidable partnership with Jamie Cureton that season, with the U's eventually finishing 10th in The Championship. Whilst at Colchester, he helped them achieve promotion to the Championship in 2006 and finish in a club record 10th position the following season. Iwelumo rejected a new contract offer from Colchester on 21 May 2007,[16] On the same day signed for Charlton Athletic on a free transfer.[17] In the 2007–08 season he featured in every league game and was the Addicks' top goalscorer; he was also named the Championship's player of the month for November 2007 after scoring last minute winning goals in two consecutive games.[18] It was confirmed that Iwelumo could leave Charlton as part of cost-cutting measures and he eventually signed for fellow Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers in July 2008 on a two-year deal.[19] Iwelumo scored a hat-trick for Wolves against Preston North End in a 3–1 win, taking his goal tally to eight for the season, where he was also sent off for an apparent head-butt on defender Sean St Ledger.[20] Wolves made an appeal against this, which was turned down, despite St Ledger stating that the clash of heads was accidental and Iwelumo served a three-match ban.[21] His early season form in front of goal earned him November's Championship Player of the Month Award.[22] However, after this run of form he entered a goalless drought of 16 games before netting against his former club Charlton. His season was ended prematurely after a high tackle from Lee Carsley in the game against promotion rivals Birmingham City left him with medial ligament damage.[23] In his absence the team secured promotion to the Premier League as champions.[24] He regained fitness over the summer break but suffered more injury woe as he broke his metatarsal in Wolves' opening pre-season game against Australian club Perth Glory.[25] He eventually returned to first team contention and made his Premier League debut in a 1–1 draw against Aston Villa in October 2009, though again suffered an injury setback which put him on the sidelines for a further month.[26] When fit, his Premier League appearance were limited to fleeting substitute roles and he instead moved on a month's loan to Championship side Bristol City in February 2010 to gain more playing time.[27] He scored the first of two goals for Bristol City in a 2–1 win over West Bromwich Albion on 21 February 2010.[28] He returned to Wolves to battle for his place, making a handful of further substitute appearances as the club confirmed their Premier League survival, but failing to score, meaning he had scored just once for Wolves in 18 months. He signed for Championship side Burnley on 1 June 2010 on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee.[29] Iwelumo scored his first goal for Burnley on his debut on 7 August 2010, scoring the winner against Nottingham Forest in a 1–0 victory for Burnley. On 11 September 2010 Iwelumo scored a stunning hattrick against Preston North End in a 4–3 win for Burnley at home, with two fine headers and a volley. After a disappointing second half to the season, Iwelumo was subject to transfer speculation, with a failed move to Preston North End. Iwelumo signed for Championship rivals Watford on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee on 19 July 2011.[30] Iwelumo made his debut for Watford against former club Burnley on the opening day of the season. The game finished 2–2.[31] Iwelumo scored his first goal for Watford against Hull City in October and had to wait another five months before scoring again in which he bagged a brace against Leeds United on 31 March 2012.[32] Following an injury to John Eustace at the start of the 2012–13 season and the departure of Martin Taylor, Iwelumo captained Watford for the first time against Derby County on 1 September 2012. Iwelumo joined Notts County on loan on 23 November.[33] He returned to Watford after failing to score for the ""Magpies"" in five matches.[34] On 31 January 2013, Iwelumo joined Oldham Athletic on loan until the end of the 2012–13 season.[35] On 3 June 2013 Iwelumo joined League Two side Scunthorpe United on a one-year deal.[36] He spent six months at Scunthorpe before joining St Johnstone on 23 January 2014.[37] Iwelumo was an unused substitute as St Johnstone won the 2014 Scottish Cup Final. He joined Conference Premier side Chester on 30 June 2014,[38] but announced his retirement from football on 28 October 2014.[39] Iwelumo was called up for the Scotland squad to tour South Korea in 2002 but had to withdraw as his club Stoke City were involved in the Football League Championship play-offs. In November 2007, he was named in the Scotland B team for a friendly against Republic of Ireland B,[40] which he featured in as Scotland drew 1–1.[41] He was called up to the full Scotland squad for a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Norway at Hampden Park on 11 October 2008.[42] He came on as a 57th-minute substitute in that game to make his debut, but his performance was overshadowed by an open goal miss from three yards, in a match that finished 0–0.[43][44] For days after, Iwelumo constantly watched video replays of the incident but was determined not to be remembered for the miss, stated ""I'm a proud Scot, I love my country and it's my dream to do well for them.""[45] He was recalled for his first international start in a friendly against Argentina on 19 November 2008.[46] In October 2014, one day after he announced his retirement from playing, Iwelumo began working in the media department at his former club Stoke City.[47] In July 2015, Iwelumo was appointed head coach of the under-18 team at former club Wolverhampton Wanderers.[48] However, he quit the position less than a week later.[49] In November 2016 he re-joined former club Chester as assistant manager to Jon McCarthy but continued to work as a pundit for Channel 5's Football League Show. In June 2017, citing concerns from fans about his absence on matchdays, he moved into the role of first-team striker coach.[50][51] Iwelumo graduated from Staffordshire University in 2016 with a first-class bachelor's degree in Professional Sports Writing and Broadcasting.[52] Iwelumo can often be heard as a co-commentator on talkSPORT.

"74471",":Article","  František Plánička ( Czech pronunciation: [ˈfraɲcɪʃɛk ˈplaːɲɪtʃka]; 2 July 1904 – 20 July 1996) was a Czech football goalkeeper and one of the most honoured players in the history of Czechoslovak football. He played all his career for Slavia Prague, during which time the club won the Czech league eight times and the Mitropa Cup once. He also became a member of the Czechoslovakia national team, where his first success as a young goalkeeper was helping Czechoslovakia to become runner-up in the Central European International Cup 1931-32 and later became captain during the World Cup finals of 1934 (where the Czechoslovakia team finished second) and 1938. Plánička was a courageous player, to the extent that in Czechoslovakia's 1938 World Cup match against Brazil, he remained on the field despite having suffered a serious injury.[1] He was a goalkeeper of outstanding reflexes and shot-stopping abilities[2] and was also characterized by his sportsmanship, never once being cautioned or sent off in his career. He was awarded the UNESCO International Fair Play Award in 1985.[3] Regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, and of all time, in 1999, the IFFHS elected him the best Czech goalkeeper – as well as the sixth best in Europe and the ninth best overall – of the twentieth century.[4][5] In 2003, he was catalogued as the greatest goalkeeper of an era[2][6] that included other notable keepers such as Ricardo Zamora and Gianpiero Combi.[7] Born in Prague, Plánička played most of his footballing career and lived most of his life in the Czech capital. In the beginning of his career, Plánička played for the clubs Slovan Praha VII, Union VII, Staroměstský SK Olympia, and SK Bubeneč. He played for Slavia Prague from 1923 to 1938, in what has been one of the most successful eras in the club's history. During thirteen seasons with the club between 1925 and 1938, Slavia won seven league titles and Plánička played 196 league matches.[8] He appeared in a total of 969 matches, of which Slavia won 742.[9] Despite being of below-average height for a goalkeeper, at 1.72m (5 ft 8 in),[10] he was an effective shot stopper, and his acrobatic style earned him the nickname The Cat of Prague.[11] In 1932, Slavia reached the semifinals of the Mitropa Cup. In the first leg, they beat Juventus 4–0; in the second leg, Juventus had a 2–0 lead after which, according to RSSSF, Slavia resorted to obstruction and time wasting, which extended to the stands to the point that spectators started throwing stones on the pitch; one of the projectiles hit Plánička, causing him a serious injury. Slavia abandoned the pitch and the game stopped, and this led to their disqualification from the tournament.[12] Plánička also won six Bohemia cups (a domestic tournament) with Slavia, in 1926, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932, and 1935. His only international title came in 1938, when his club finally won the Mitropa Cup. Between 1926 and 1938, Plánička played 73 times in goal for Czechoslovakia,[13] a world record at the time and a national record that stood until 1966 when Ladislav Novák earned his 74th cap.[14] Plánička was the national team captain 37 times.[6][9] His international debut was on 17 January 1926 in a 1–3 loss against Italy. Plánička helped Czechoslovakia qualify to the 1934 World Cup, and was the team's captain in the tournament. After beating Romania in the first round and Switzerland in quarterfinals, the Czech played a semifinal against Germany. The Czech took the lead early in the match, but Germany equalized in the second half when Plánička could not react to a long shot by Rudolf Noack.[15] Czechoslovakia regained the lead and scored a third goal late in the game to win 3–1 and advance to the final. On 10 June 1934 Czechoslovakia played the final against hosts Italy, who also had one of the great goalkeepers of the time, Gianpiero Combi, as its captain. The Czechs took the lead in the 71st minute with a goal by Antonín Puč, but ten minutes later a shot by Raimundo Orsi beat Plánička for the equalizer, sending the match to extra time, where goal by Angelo Schiavio gave the Italians the victory. Plánička finished the tournament with six goals against in four matches. As Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, Plánička captained the Czechs again to the 1938 World Cup. In the first round, they beat the Netherlands 3–0 with all three goals coming in extra time. In the second round, they faced Brazil on 12 July, in what was one of the most violent matches in World Cup history, known as the ""Battle of Bordeaux."" One Czech and two Brazilian players were sent off, and players from both teams suffered serious injuries. With the game tied 1–1, Plánička's teammate Oldřich Nejedlý had to abandon the pitch with a broken leg, and then Plánička himself suffered a broken arm, after colliding with Brazil's striker Perácio's kick, as the Brazilian attempted to shoot.[1] Plánička did not leave the pitch, however, and instead played through the pain until the end of regulation and through the subsequent extra time, which had no change in the score.[2][16] The game was replayed two days later, and Czechoslovakia, without Plánička or forwards Nejedlý and Antonín Puč, lost 2–1 and was eliminated. Plánička only conceded one goal in 240 minutes played, having the lowest goals against average with 0.38 goals per 90 minutes (better than Aldo Olivieri of champions Italy).[17] He was selected to the Best XI of the tournament by a group of journalists. The match against Brazil in Bordeaux was the last one of Plánička's international career. Plánička continued to play football after his retirement, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and physical condition.[18] On 4 July 1970 Plánička last played in goal in a senior team of former internationals.[18] In 1985, UNESCO presented him with an Honorary Fair Play Award in recognition to his footballing career. In 1994, after receiving a sports merit award, Plánička stated that he would like to see Slavia win the league while he was still alive. In the 1995–1996 season, after a 48-year wait, Slavia won the league title, and Plánička was able to celebrate it. Two months later, he died at the age of 92.[19] At the time of his death, he was the last living member of the Czech squad at the 1934 World Cup and the last surviving player from either team to play in the final. Czech national team midfielder Karel Poborský attended his burial, postponing his contract signing with Manchester United, which was scheduled to happen the same day.[10]","František

"74472",":Article","  Marco Cassetti ( Italian pronunciation: [ˈmarko kasˈsetti]; born 29 May 1977) is an Italian former footballer who played as a defender. Born in Brescia, he has previously played in Serie A for Verona, Lecce and Roma and in England with Watford. Cassetti won five caps for Italy at full international level. Principally a right-back, Cassetti started his career as a right midfielder. He has also played as a central defender.[3] Cassetti started his football career at Montichiari, an amateur-level club inside the province of Brescia. In his two seasons with them, he made 30 appearances and scored six goals. He then moved on to a Serie C1 team, Lumezzane, where he also stayed for two years. His debut in the Serie A came with Hellas Verona F.C. in a 1–1 draw with Bari. He was often a sub in his first two years with them but became a starter the next year when they were relegated to the Serie B. After that, he was a typical starter for Lecce, playing with them for three seasons. In the 2006–07 season, Cassetti left Lecce to sign a four-year contract with Roma on a co-ownership deal for €1.5M due to Lecce's relegation.[4] His teammate Mirko Vučinić also joined on loan for €3.25M. In June 2007, the remain registration rights of Cassetti were bought for €851,500.[5] In December 2009, he scored a winner against Lazio. On that day he became a hero for all Roma fans. On 3 June 2010, he signed a new 1-year deal with Roma and his pre-tax salary was increased to €1.8M from €1.34M.[6] His contract was renewed again in March 2011.[7] He then became a second choice as a right back, with Aleandro Rosi being favoured over him. He played only five matches in the first part of the 2011–12 season due to his injury; towards the end of the season, Cassetti stated that he experienced less playing time due to manager Luis Enrique considering him as more of a centre-back player rather than a right-back. At the end of the 2011–12 season, it became clear that Roma decided against offering Cassetti a contract extension, meaning he would leave the capital club at the end of the season.[8] On 23 August 2012, Cassetti signed for Udinese on a one-year deal, agreeing to join Watford on a season-long loan on the same day. Udinese did not publicise their signing of Cassetti, meaning that it was a move purely for the benefit of the English Championship club.[9][10] In June 2013, Cassetti signed for Watford permanently and scored his first goal for the club in a 3–3 draw at home to Blackburn Rovers on 25 March 2014.[11] After two years at Vicarage Road, Cassetti announced he would be leaving Watford upon the expiry of his contract in May 2014.[12] Roma manager Rudi Garcia had allowed Cassetti to train with the club in September, and in January 2015, Cassetti agreed a deal to join Lega Pro side Como.[13] Cassetti has been capped for the Italy national team five times at senior level. He was the first Lecce player ever to play for the national team when he earned his first cap in 2005. He played his last game for Italy in a 2008 2–1 over Cyprus in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, under Marcello Lippi. In September 2020, Cassetti successfully obtained his UEFA Pro coaching license.[14] Later in 2022, Cassetti agreed to rejoin Roma as a youth coach.[15] In December 2023, Cassetti served as an interim head coach for Como as Cesc Fàbregas's coaching authorization had expired and the appointment of new head coach Osian Roberts was not formally confirmed in time by the Football League; on his only game in charge, he guided Como to a 2–1 away win against Cosenza on 26 December 2023.[16]","Marco Cassetti","[""Marco Cassetti"",""Roma"",""Montichiari"",""defender"",""pronunciation"",""Lecce"",""contract"",""Italian"",""Watford"",""right-back"",""team"",""level"",""ˈmarko kasˈsetti"",""career"",""defender."",""football career"",""caps"",""midfielder"",""Udinese"",""Brescia"",""Mirko Vučinić"",""England"",""Verona"",""Serie A"",""capital club"",""seasons"",""Rudi Garcia"",""Luis Enrique"",""Como."",""debut"",""goals"",""draw"",""starter"",""season"",""season"",""season"",""sub"",""season"",""province"",""appearances"",""back"",""deal"",""deal"",""contract"",""registration rights"",""right-back"",""deal"",""centre-back player"",""loan"",""move"",""Osian Roberts"",""loan"",""fans"",""hero"",""salary"",""choice"",""part"",""injury"",""winner"",""relegation."",""club"",""deal"",""team"",""team"",""more"",""contract extension"",""Lumezzane"",""Serie C1"",""Bari"",""Serie B."",""level"",""times"",""cap"",""qualification"",""head coach"",""youth coach."",""coaching"",""Aleandro Rosi"",""Lazio"",""game"",""matches"",""appointment"",""win"",""coaching authorization"",""charge"",""club"",""2010 FIFA World Cup"",""Cyprus"",""Marcello Lippi"",""game"",""Como"",""Como"",""draw"",""goal"",""UEFA Pro"",""signing"",""home"",""expiry"",""Championship"",""benefit"",""Cosenza"",""Football League"",""Cesc Fàbregas"",""English"",""Blackburn Rovers"",""Vicarage Road"",""2014"",""1"",""June 2007"",""December 2009"",""3 June 2010"",""March 2011"",""2011"",""2011"",""23 August 2012"",""June 2013"",""25 March 2014"",""May 2014"",""January 2015"",""2005"",""2008"",""2010"",""September 2020"",""2022"",""December 2023"",""26 December 2023"",""€1.5M"",""€3.25M."",""€851,500"",""€1.8M"",""€1.34M."",""2009"",""2008"",""1"",""five"",""1977"",""five"",""four"",""2011"",""12"",""29 May 1977"",""6"",""2005"",""30"",""2023"",""two"",""29"",""12"",""2013"",""two"",""five"",""3"",""two"",""25"",""7"",""2020"",""2011"",""2015"",""851,500"",""15"",""2014"",""2022"",""2"",""2011"",""26"",""2012"",""1"",""5"",""1.8M"",""2010"",""14"",""07"",""two"",""six"",""2006"",""2"",""three"",""16"",""9"",""23"",""12"",""1.5M"",""2023"",""3"",""1"",""10"",""3"",""11"",""4"",""8"",""1"",""one"",""3"",""2007"",""3.25M."",""1.34M."",""2010"",""13"",""2006""]","0.002389486148830619","true","[0.80948466,0.01946677,0.008945009,0.008249184,0.0072519844,0.005734182,0.005658202,0.0055197235,0.0054707434,0.0046346583,0.0044471626,0.00433165,0.004296729,0.003937987,0.003927221,0.003927221,0.003472341,0.0034601009,0.0032001033,0.0030750749,0.0025670642,0.0023499355,0.0023499355,0.0023499355,0.0022876111,0.0021090962,0.001882659,0.0018176776,0.001706745,0.0015059655,0.0014844453,0.0014792021,0.0014770607,0.0014269901,0.0014269901,0.0014141013,0.00141409,0.0013080647,0.0013068359,0.0013039082,0.0011835874,0.0011835874,0.0011717399,0.0011717399,0.0010910117,0.0010848455,0.0010838567,0.0010100978,9.950789E-4,9.564924E-4,9.5493364E-4,9.204334E-4,8.83791E-4,8.83791E-4,8.8284514E-4,8.8284514E-4,8.8197587E-4,8.8197587E-4,8.740054E-4,8.740054E-4,8.6499995E-4,8.159777E-4,8.159777E-4,8.153298E-4,8.0917234E-4,7.8877696E-4,7.691835E-4,7.691835E-4,7.6792034E-4,7.668079E-4,7.597412E-4,7.597412E-4,6.081018E-4,6.076481E-4,6.039696E-4,6.039696E-4,6.039696E-4,5.2169367E-4,5.1646814E-4,4.837902E-4,4.3189057E-4,4.2489948E-4,4.2489948E-4,4.2489948E-4,4.2489948E-4,3.7914186E-4,3.5903233E-4,3.5903233E-4,3.5903233E-4,3.387553E-4,3.1341385E-4,3.1341385E-4,3.0368546E-4,3.0368546E-4,2.858355E-4,2.6671257E-4,2.6671257E-4,2.6671257E-4,2.6671257E-4,2.6671257E-4,2.5103524E-4,2.5103524E-4,2.5103524E-4,1.7941164E-4,1.5756633E-4,1.5756633E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Marco Cassetti - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Cassetti",,,,,,,
"74473",":Article","  José María Movilla Cubero (born 8 February 1975) is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played mainly as a central midfielder. He played 299 La Liga matches in exactly ten seasons, representing mainly Zaragoza and retiring at 39.[1][2] An unsuccessful graduate from Real Madrid's system, Madrid-born Movilla started his professional career with modest clubs: CDC Moscardó, CD Numancia and CD Ourense.[3] He signed with Málaga CF in January 1998, being instrumental in the Andalusia side's promotion from Segunda División B to La Liga in just two years.[4] Returning to Segunda División, Movilla joined Atlético Madrid, where he managed another promotion in the 2001–02 season while playing all 38 games. He arrived on loan to Real Zaragoza in January 2004, helping them to avoid top-flight relegation and win the Copa del Rey.[5] The move was made permanent subsequently, and Movilla spent three additional campaigns with the Aragonese, after which he joined newly promoted Real Murcia.

"74475",":Article","  Lars Hening Joel Ekstrand (born 4 February 1989) is a Swedish former professional footballer who played as a defender. Beginning his career with Helsingborgs IF in 2008, he moved on to represent Udinese, Watford, Bristol City, and Rotherham before retiring at AIK in 2019. A full international between 2010 and 2014, he won two caps for the Sweden national team. Born in Lund, Sweden, Ekstrand started playing football for his home town club Lunds BK as a youth player before moving to Helsingborgs IF in 2005.[3] Two years later, he signed his first professional contract with the club in the summer.[3] In February 2008, Ekstrand was called up by the Helsingborgs IF squad for the first time,[3] He made his first team debut against PSV Eindhoven in the first leg of the UEFA Cup Round of 32, at Philips Stadion, which saw Helsingborgs lose 2–0.[4] Ekstrand was featured again in the second leg of the UEFA Cup Round of 32, at Olympia stadium and played 45 minutes before being substituted, due to a groin injury, as the club lost 2–1, resulting in their elimination from the tournament.[5] But he soon recovered and made his league debut for Helsingborgs IF, starting the whole game, in a 3–0 win over GIF Sundsvall in the opening game of the season.[6] During a 2–2 draw against IFK Norrköping on 20 April 2008, Ekstrand started the game but was substituted in the 7th minute following a collision and suffered a broken nose and concussion.[7] But he quickly recovered and made his return to the first team from injury, starting the whole game, in a 4–2 win over Malmö on 28 April 2008.[8] Since then, Ekstrand had developed himself into a key player at Helsingborg IF with the likes of Marcus Nilsson, Andreas Granqvist and Samir Beloufa.[9] Despite missing three matches throughout the 2008 season, he went on to make twenty–eight appearances in all competitions.[10] Following this, Ekstrand was nominated for the Newcomer of the Year but lost out to Robin Söder.[11] At the start of the 2009 season, Ekstrand helped Helsingborgs IF side go to their winning form in the first three league matches to the season.[12] However, in a match against Örebro on 20 April 2009, he received a straight red card in the 44th minute, just one minute before the half–time, in a 2–0 loss.[13] After serving a one match suspension, Ekstrand returned to the first team and provided a goal for Rasmus Jönsson, who went on to score a hat–trick, in a 3–0 win over AIK on 29 April 2009.[14] This was followed up by helping the club keep two clean sheets in the next two matches against Malmö and IF Brommapojkarna.[15] Following his return to the first team from suspension, he continued to regain his first team place for Helsingborgs IF, forming a centre–back partnership with Nilsson.[16] On 11 June 2009, Ekstrand, along with Nilssson, signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2012.[17] He then scored his first goal for Helsingborgs IF in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League second round, in a 2–2 draw against Zestafoni to help the club advance to the next round.[18] In a match against FK Sarajevo in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League third round, Ekstrand played 120 minutes, resulting in a penalty shootout with the opposition team winning 2–1 and missed the penalty, which saw Helsingborgs IF eliminated from the tournament.[19] However, he received a straight red card in the 24th minute for giving away a penalty, in a 3–0 loss against Örgryte on 18 October 2009.[20] Despite being sidelined, due to suspension and injuries much further, Ekstrand went on to make thirty–two appearances and scoring once in all competitions.[21] At the start of the 2010 season, Ekstrand was in defensive first team position when he helped the side go on unbeaten run for Helsingborgs IF's first twelve matches to the start season.[22] While the club go on the unbeaten run, he received a straight red card in the first half, in a 1–0 win over Mjällby on 26 April 2010 and served a two match suspension.[23] After returning to the first team, Ekstrand scored his first league goal for the club, in a 3–1 win over Gefle on 10 May 2010.[24] Since returning from suspension, he continued to regain his first team place for Helsingborgs IF, forming a centre–back partnership with Nilsson and helping the club to keep their league title chance alive.[25] However, Ekstrand faced further setbacks later in the 2010 season when he was suspended on two occasions, including another straight red card in a 0–0 draw against Göteborg on 15 August 2010, as well as, facing his injury concern.[26] It wasn't until on 6 November 2010 when he returned to the starting line–up in the Helsingborgs IF's last game of the season against Kalmar and played 76 minutes before being substituted, in a 1–0 draw but cost the club to win the league title, as title contender rival, Malmö FF, won the league following their win.[27] In a follow–up match, Ekstrand started in the Svenska Cupen Final against Hammarby and helped Helsingborgs win the tournament by beating the opposition team 1–0 on 13 November 2010.[28] At the end of the 2010 season, he went on to make twenty–five appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Following this, Ekstrand was nominated for the player's defender of the year but he lost out to Olof Mellberg.[29] With the 2010 season ended, Ekstrand was linked a move away from Helsingborgs IF, as clubs from Italy were keen on signing him.[30] The club confirmed that Ekstrand was expected to leave the club.[31] After a much speculation over his future, it was announced that Ekstrand joined Udinese in 2011.[32] On 18 January 2011, Ekstrand penned a four-year deal with Serie A side Udinese, keeping him through to 2015.[33] Prior to the move, he spoke out about joining Udinese, quoting: ""It has always been a dream. It is a big football country that took World Cup gold not long ago. Here are big clubs and the best Swedish is playing in Serie A. For me it will be an honor to join.""[34] Since joining the club, however, Ekstrand found himself out of first team, as he mostly sat out from the squad, as well as, facing competition from Andrea Coda.[35] It wasn't until on 8 May 2011 when Ekstrand made his debut for Udinese, coming on in the 70th minute in a 2–1 win against Lazio.[36] This turns out to be his only appearance of the 2010–11 season. At the start of the 2011–12 season, Ekstrand made his first start for Udinese in a Champions League qualifying game against Arsenal.[37] For this match, the club changed from the previous season's 3–5–2 formation to 4–1–4–1, where wing-backs Mauricio Isla and Pablo Armero became midfielders, thus using 4 defenders instead of 3 centre-backs.[38] He remained in the starting XI in the return leg a week later with Udinese losing 2–1 (3–1 agg).[39] However, he continued to find his first team opportunities limited and found himself placed on the substitute bench, due to competitions from Medhi Benatia and Danilo.[40] But Ekstrand made only five starts by the end of the year, coming from the league and UEFA Europa League and saw the club qualify for the knockout stage.[41] He then made a further five more starts for Udinese later in the 2011–12 season.[42] At the end of the 2011–12 season, Ekstrand went on to make a further 17 appearances in all competitions. On 31 August 2012, Ekstrand joined Championship side Watford on a season-long loan from Udinese.[43] It came after when the player informed the club's management that he wanted to leave Udinese for first team football.[44] Esktrand was close to joining Eredivisie side Groningen but collapsed over transfer demands.[45] Having been out of the first team for a month, he made his debut for the club, coming on in the second half to replace Neuton, in a 2–1 loss against Charlton Athletic on 2 October 2012.[46] Following this, Ekstrand became a first team regular, playing in the centre–back position for the next sixteen league matches for Watford, as the club found themselves to get promoted to the Premier League.[47] This lasted until he suffered a knee injury and was substituted in the 78th minute during Watford's win against Bolton Wanderers on 2 February 2013.[48] His knee injury cost him a place to be in the Sweden squad and missed the next two matches as a result.[49] Ekstrand made his return to the starting line–up against Ipswich Town on 18 February 2013 and helped the club keep a clean sheet, in a 2–0 win.[50] In a follow–up match against Derby County on 23 February 2013, he scored his first Watford goal, scoring from 10 yards, in a 2–1 win.[51] From that moment on, he began to established himself in the first team for the rest of the season and helped the club finish third place in league.[52] On 12 May 2013, Ekstrand played in the semi-final second leg against Leicester City.[53] In a dramatic finale, after Watford goalkeeper Manuel Almunia saved both a penalty taken by Anthony Knockaert and a rebound which would have sent the opposition team through to the final, Troy Deeney scored in the seventh minute of added time to take the club through to the Championship Play-off Final on aggregate.[54] In the Championship Play–off Final, he played the whole game throughout 120 minutes extra time, as Watford lost the final against Crystal Palace.[55] At the end of the 2012–13 season, Ekstrand went on to make 36 appearances and scoring once in all competitions. On 24 July 2013, Watford confirmed Ekstrand had signed a three-year deal on a permanent basis, keeping him until 2016.[56] Upon joining the club, he was given a number six shirt following the departure of Fitz Hall.[57] His first appearance for Watford since joining them on a permanent basis came on 6 August 2013, where Ekstrand captained the club and starting the whole game, in a 3–1 win over Bristol Rovers in the first round of the League Cup.[58] Following this, he continued to remain in the first team regular for the club, playing in the centre–back position despite having two managers this season.[59] Ekstrand then made his 50th appearance for Watford, starting the whole game, in a 2–1 win against Huddersfield Town on 5 October 2013.[60] However, he suffered setback of injuries and suspension throughout the 2013–14 season.[61] At the end of the 2013–14 season, Ekstrand went on to make thirty–nine appearances in all competitions. Prior to the 2014–15 season, Ekstrand was keen on leaving Watford despite having a remaining two years to his contract.[62] Amid the transfer speculation, Ekstrand made a poor start of the season when he was ""sent–off after just two minutes for a collision with Nathan Redmond"", in a 3–0 loss against Norwich City on 16 August 2014.[63] After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the first team against Huddersfield Town on 30 August 2014, starting the whole game, in a 4–2 win.[64] Since returning from suspension, Ekstrand continued to regain his first team place, playing in the centre–back position for the next thirteen league matches despite facing competitions along the way.[65] However, by December, he was dropped from the first team squad by manager Slaviša Jokanović, due to his change of formation 3–5–2 tactics and Football League rules on home-grown player as the reason Ekstrand was dropped from the first team squad.[66] By late–December, he faced his own injury concern that saw him out for a month.[67] After returning to training from injury in February, Ekstrand returned to the starting line–up against Bolton Wanderers on 14 February 2015 and scored his first goal for the club in two years, in a 4–3 win.[68] However, during a 3–2 win against Leeds United on 28 February 2015, he suffered a hamstring injury and was substituted in the 42nd minute, resulting in him missing the next two matches.[69] But Ekstrand returned to the starting line–up against Reading on 14 March 2015 and helped Watford win 4–1.[70] However, his return was short–lived when it was announced on 24 March 2015 that he would be out for up to nine months after damaging his cruciate ligament in a Football League Championship match against Ipswich Town three days ago.[71] While on the sidelines, Watford gained promotion to the Premier League.[72] At the end of the 2014–15 season, Ekstrand went on to make twenty–five appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Following this, Ekstrand continued to rehabilitate with his knee injury and was dropped from the Premier League squad for the 2015–16 season.[73] By late–November, he made his return to full training after making a recovery on his knee.[74] Ekstrand then made a playing comeback from injury in January 2016 after being out injured since March 2015, playing two matches for Watford's development squad, however he picked up an injury in an against Boreham Wood on 26 January 2016.[75] In February 2016, then Watford Manager Quique Sánchez Flores revealed the club were in talks to extend Ekstrand's contract at the club despite Ekstrand still recovering from injury, with Flores describing the player: ""Ekstrand could be a very interesting central defender for the future. He has experience and plays football very well.""[76] However, Sánchez Flores' was denied by Ekstrand, saying he hasn't been offered a new contract by Watford but was keen on staying at the club.[77] Ekstrand later said that injury was ""the hardest eleven months of his career.""[78] After failing to make a first team appearance during the 2015–16 season due to injury and his contract situation changing after a change in management with Quique Sánchez Flores leaving the club and being replaced by Walter Mazzarri, on 3 June 2016, it was announced that Ekstrand would leave Watford upon the expiry of his contract.[79] After leaving Watford, it was announced on 13 July 2016 that Ekstrand had been set to sign for Championship club Leeds United on a free transfer, however after a medical and negotiations with the player, Leeds then pulled out of the deal[80] Following this, he later reflected his experience at his medical prior to joining Leeds United.[81] On 6 September 2016, Ekstrand signed for Championship club Bristol City on a one-year deal, after training with the squad during August.[82] He was previously linked with a move to the club before joining in favour of Leeds United, only for the move to broke down.[83] Ekstrand made his debut for Bristol City in the 2–2 draw with Rotherham United on 10 September 2016, coming on as a substitute for Scott Golbourne.[84] His second appearance for the club came on 17 September 2016, making his first start, in a 1–1 draw against Derby County.[85] However, he was soon sidelined with a hamstring injury and illness, keeping him out for several months.[86] Even after returning from injury, Ekstrand remained out of the first team until his release by the club, which he only made two appearances for the club.[87][88] On 2 February 2017, free agent Ekstrand signed for fellow Championship side Rotherham United on a deal until the end of the season.[89] He made his Rotherham United (and his only appearance) debut, making his first start for the side and played 68 minutes before being substituted, in a 5–0 loss to the hands of Cardiff City on 16 February 2017.[90] This turns out to be his only appearance for the club, as Ekstrand suffered a knee injury and was sidelined for the rest of the 2016–17 season.[91] He left Rotherham United at the end of his contract.[92] After leaving Rotherham United, Ekstrand was linked with a move back to Sweden, with IFK Göteborg keen on signing him, but the move was broken down over money problems.[93][94] On 15 January 2018, he signed a 3-year contract with AIK, making his return to Allsvenskan and Swedish football for the first time in eight years.[95] Upon joining the club, Ekstrand said: ""I felt that I wanted to get started and come back to Sweden. AIK is a fantastic club and when I played in Helsingborg before, the away match against AIK was the best of the year. It feels perfect to be here and I will do everything to contribute to the team.""[96] Ekstrand made his debut for the club, coming on in the 85th minute in a 3–0 win against Halmstads BK on 5 March 2018 in the Svenska Cupen match.[97] However, he suffered an injury and was eventually for eight months.[98] It wasn't until on 11 November 2018 when Ekstrand made his return to the starting line–up against Kalmar, coming on in the 85th minute and played for the rest of the game, as AIK won 1–0, a victory that saw the club win the 2018 Allsvenskan.[99] At the end of the 2018 season, he went on to make two appearances in all competitions.

"74476",":Article","  Jonathan Lee Hogg (born 6 December 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for and captains EFL Championship club Huddersfield Town. He has previously played for Watford and Aston Villa, and spent periods on loan at Darlington and Portsmouth. Hogg was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire.[1] A midfielder, he began his football career as a junior with hometown club Middlesbrough, before joining Aston Villa.[2] His progress was interrupted by a cruciate ligament injury in March 2007,[3] but he came back to become Villa's reserve team's leading goalscorer as they won the 2008–09 Premier Reserve League Southern section.[4] Handed a two-year contract in July 2008,[5] he was part of Villa's squad that won the 2009 Peace Cup, a pre-season tournament.[3] On 19 August 2010, Hogg made his first competitive start for Aston Villa in a 1–1 draw away to Rapid Vienna in the Europa League Play-off round. Owing to injuries to several other midfield players, he made his Premier League debut in the home match against Manchester United on 13 November 2010.[6] In December 2010, Hogg signed a new contract to tie him to the club until 2013.[7] In November 2009, Hogg joined League Two's last-placed side Darlington on loan for six weeks.[8] He made his debut in the Football League on 21 November away at Chesterfield; he played the whole game, and scored in the 87th minute to set up a close finish, but Chesterfield's Scott Boden scored twice very late in the game to make the final score 5–2.[9] On 25 January 2011, Hogg joined Championship club Portsmouth on loan until the end of the season.[7] He made his debut the same day in a 2–1 home league defeat to Burnley.[10] Hogg joined Football League Championship club Watford for an undisclosed fee on 27 August 2011, signing a three-year contract,[11][12][13] joining his former Villa youth teammate, Troy Deeney, at Vicarage Road in the process. He made his debut for Watford two days later against Aston Villa's arch-rivals, Birmingham City. Hogg finished the season having started 40 games in the league and came fourth in the Watford F.C. Player of the Season award.[14] Hogg had the assist for one of English football's most famous goals,[15][16] when his knockdown of a Fernando Forestieri cross in the 96th minute of the second leg of the 2013 Championship Play-Off Semifinal drew out Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. The ball fell in the path of Deeney, who scored the winning goal, sending Watford on to the final. The opportunity immediately followed a double-save by Watford goalkeeper Manuel Almunia on a penalty and follow-up by Leicester midfielder Anthony Knockaert, which, if converted, would have sent Leicester on instead of Watford. Hogg and Deeney celebrated the winner by leaping into the Graham Taylor stand at Vicarage Road, part of the ensuing celebratory pitch invasion at Watford's home ground. Despite being a first-team regular at Watford, Hogg joined Huddersfield Town on a three-year contract on 29 July 2013, motivated by family reasons to request the transfer.[17] He made his debut for the Terriers in their 1–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 3 August. He scored his first goal for the club in the 3–2 win over Charlton Athletic in the Football League Cup on 27 August 2013.[18] His first league goal for the Terriers came in their 2–1 win over Barnsley on 20 August 2016, his first league goal in 7 years. In the 2016–17 season, Huddersfield Town gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time. Hogg was voted ""Player's Player of the Year"" by his teammates.[19] During that season, Hogg suffered a collision with a teammate and was taken to hospital after a defeat away at Bristol City on 17 March 2017. He was initially ruled out for the remainder of the season after fears that he had fractured his neck. However, after further scans, he was allowed to return less than a month later on 5 April for a victory against Norwich City.[20] On 9 August 2017, manager David Wagner appointed Tommy Smith as the club captain with Hogg and German defender Christopher Schindler as his deputies.[21] During his eight seasons at Huddersfield to date, the tough-tackling central midfielder has become a crowd favourite,[citation needed] making over 250 appearances for the club. On 13 March 2021 the former Huddersfield manager, Danny Cowley, referred to Hogg as ""...a fantastic professional. He brings so much to the team, not only in terms of his ability as a player but also the substance he brings. When he plays he gives them the grit and the determination that Huddersfield need”.[22][23] Hogg scored just his second goal for Huddersfield on 7 April 2021, a header from a corner, which proved to be a consolation in a home 2–1 defeat to AFC Bournemouth.[24] On 7 May 2021, he was named by supporters as the club's Blue & White Foundation Player of the Year, ahead of teammate Lewis O'Brien.[25] Two weeks later, Hogg also received the Hargreaves Memorial Player of the Year Trophy, receiving 35% of supporters' votes.[26] On 29 June 2021 Hogg was appointed club captain. Head Coach Carlos Corberán was quoted as saying “Being a Captain is not only when you have the armband on a game day. You must lead by example. You must be a professional footballer 24/7 and bring everyone else up to your standards, so they have the same mentality. We know that Hoggy will do that.”.[27] On 14 September 2021 Hogg scored his third league goal for Huddersfield in a 3–0 away win at Blackpool. He chested the ball down and struck a half volley from just outside the area into the top corner of the goal.[28] On 30 October 2021 Hogg scored his second goal of the season with a late header at home to Millwall from a Sorba Thomas corner, which proved to be the only goal of the game.[29] Huddersfield Town","Jonathan Hogg","[""Jonathan Lee Hogg"",""Villa"",""reserve team"",""Huddersfield

"74477",":Article","  Álvaro Rubio Robles (born 18 April 1979) is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He spent most of his career with Valladolid, appearing in 310 games in all competitions.[1] In La Liga he also represented Albacete, for a total of 204 matches in that competition over eight seasons (four goals). Born in Logroño, La Rioja, Rubio began his professional career with Real Zaragoza, but never made it past the reserves. In January 2000, he moved to Albacete Balompié – first on loan – where, after a slow start, he became a very important unit for the Castile-La Mancha side in the Segunda División.[2] After 25 matches in the 2002–03 season, as Albacete returned to La Liga after a seven-year absence,[2] Rubio made his top-division debut on 26 October 2003 in a 3–2 away loss against Real Betis where he came on as a 27th-minute substitute.[3] He made a further 50 appearances until June 2005, when the team were relegated.[2] For the 2006–07 campaign, Rubio signed with Real Valladolid, being promoted to the top flight in his first year[4] and rarely missing a game subsequently. Mainly a defensive-minded player, he scored his first goals as a professional in 2007–08, the first coming on 28 October 2007 in a 2–2 draw at CA Osasuna (three for the season).[5] Rubio could only appear in 16 league games in 2009–10 due to injuries, and Valladolid dropped down to division two for the first time in three years. Although still afflicted by physical problems,[6] he helped to another promotion in 2012, contributing 20 starts to the feat and going on to be a regular in the following two top-tier campaigns; he continued to be heavily played as the club returned to the second division.[7] On 8 August 2016, the 37-year-old Rubio moved abroad for the first time in his career, signing for I-League champions Bengaluru FC on a four-month deal.[8] On 30 November, after five appearances in the AFC Cup to help his team reach the final, he left.[9] Rubio was part of the Spain under-20 squad at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship that also included the likes of Iker Casillas and Xavi. He featured in the 3–1 group stage win against Honduras, as the tournament in Nigeria ended in conquest.[10] Rubio found the net in his only appearance for the under-21 team, a 2–1 home victory over Israel for the 2000 UEFA European Championship qualifiers.[11] Valladolid Bengaluru Spain U20","Álvaro Rubio","[""Álvaro Rubio Robles"",""career"",""midfielder"",""games"",""seasons"",""Spanish"",""Valladolid"",""matches"",""competition"",""goals"",""most"",""total"",""Albacete"",""La Liga"",""loss"",""squad"",""career"",""start"",""tournament"",""reserves"",""loan"",""unit"",""side"",""game"",""season"",""appearances"",""division"",""Segunda División."",""season"",""league games"",""campaign"",""goals"",""matches"",""time"",""flight"",""professional"",""debut"",""absence"",""draw"",""injuries"",""problems"",""Rubio"",""player"",""Real Zaragoza"",""La Rioja"",""Logroño"",""Albacete Balompié"",""Castile-La Mancha"",""appearances"",""champions"",""Real Valladolid"",""part"",""likes"",""final"",""team"",""team"",""appearance"",""Real Betis"",""team"",""CA Osasuna"",""1999 FIFA World Youth Championship"",""qualifiers."",""group stage win"",""net"",""home victory"",""club"",""I-League"",""Spain"",""AFC Cup"",""Bengaluru FC"",""regular"",""UEFA European Championship"",""time"",""campaigns"",""starts"",""feat"",""promotion"",""Iker Casillas"",""Xavi"",""Honduras"",""Nigeria"",""Israel"",""Bengaluru Spain U20"",""division."",""30"",""28"",""2002"",""26 October 2003"",""June 2005"",""2006"",""2007"",""28 October 2007"",""2009"",""2012"",""8 August 2016"",""30 November"",""1999"",""2000"",""07"",""2006"",""four"",""2005"",""2012"",""1999"",""2009"",""2"",""6"",""four"",""03"",""21"",""7"",""18 April 1979"",""16"",""8"",""18"",""20"",""11"",""204"",""2"",""2"",""two"",""1"",""08"",""8"",""2007"",""9"",""three"",""2"",""27"",""10"",""seven"",""2003"",""2002"",""26"",""2007"",""37"",""3"",""2000"",""5"",""2016"",""three"",""20"",""2"",""1"",""25"",""2"",""4"",""10"",""3"",""2"",""2000"",""50"",""eight"",""1979"",""1"",""3"",""two"",""five"",""310"",""January 2000""]","0.002448072458519924","true","[0.8247138,0.012452571,0.0116175385,0.0069894413,0.0069894413,0.006899005,0.006891749,0.006378598,0.006378598,0.006378598,0.0056066494,0.0056066494,0.004562652,0.0037788413,0.0036286162,0.0029306598,0.0026409386,0.002400609,0.0021466096,0.0021164163,0.0021089471,0.0021089471,0.0021089471,0.0017979889,0.0017760204,0.0017760204,0.0017668431,0.0016714657,0.0016452026,0.0016452026,0.0016400203,0.0016355267,0.0016199785,0.0015006351,0.0014406178,0.0014366697,0.001423009,0.001423009,0.001318155,0.001318155,0.0013152022,0.001260581,0.0012548688,0.0012513855,0.0012513855,0.0012513855,0.001246965,0.001246965,0.0012370825,0.0012370825,0.0011415989,0.0010802175,9.910751E-4,9.910751E-4,9.792179E-4,8.6419843E-4,8.6419843E-4,8.4112515E-4,7.9834624E-4,7.7910995E-4,7.311642E-4,6.9228595E-4,6.9228595E-4,6.9228595E-4,6.9228595E-4,6.8511575E-4,6.668556E-4,6.668556E-4,5.856986E-4,5.856986E-4,5.356025E-4,5.1068846E-4,4.946689E-4,4.946689E-4,4.946689E-4,4.344571E-4,4.344571E-4,4.0984384E-4,4.0984384E-4,4.090667E-4,4.090667E-4,4.090667E-4,4.090667E-4,3.4419986E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Álvaro Rubio - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_Rubio",,,,,,,

In 1994, he signed a youth contract with Bordeaux, spending approximately seven years in the club's youth system and one year in the Championnat de France Amateur before earning a call up to the senior team in preparation for the 2007–08 season following the signing of his professional contract.[citation needed] Trémoulinas received the number 28 shirt and served as backup to the younger Florian Marange and elder Franck Jurietti. He made his professional debut on 15 August 2007 in a league match against Le Mans,[5] and was limited to only nine league appearances, but was a regular in the club's 2007–08 UEFA Cup campaign appearing in seven matches and also scoring his first European goal in a 3–2 victory over Greek club Panionios.[6] Trémoulinas was slowly integrated into the squad for the 2008–09 season by manager Laurent Blanc, overtaking both Marange and Jurietti (though the latter was still relied more upon in important matches, such as when he started for Trémoulinas in matches against Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon, and the 2009 Coupe de la Ligue Final).[7][8] He did appear in the final as a substitute in the 17th minute for the injured Brazilian Wendel, but had to substitute out at halftime, also due to injury. Bordeaux won the match 4–0 giving Trech, as he is called by the Bordeaux faithful, his first career club honour.[citation needed] Following the final, Trémoulinas started the final five matches of the season, helping Bordeaux win their first league title since 1999. In total with the team, he appeared in 31 matches scoring his only goal of the season against Guingamp in a 4–2 victory in the Coupe de la Ligue.[9] On 29 May 2009, he signed a contract extension until June 2013.[10] Trémoulinas appeared regularly during the 2009–10 season, and attracted interest from Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Fiorentina, and Spanish club Real Madrid, quickly denying all rumours.[11][12][13] He was among the top assists providers in the league, primarily due to his crosses and ability to get forward.[14] On 12 July 2013, Trémoulinas signed a four-year contract with the Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv. He made his debut for the club sixteen days later in a 2–0 win against Sevastopol, spending 70 minutes on the pitch and also setting up one of the goals.[citation needed] On 31 January 2014, Trémoulinas was loaned out to Saint-Étienne until the end of the season, after falling down the pecking order while at Dynamo.[15] On 8 July 2014, he returned to his parent club, after appearing in 12 matches.[citation needed] On 24 August 2014, Trémoulinas signed a three-year contract with La Liga club Sevilla, initially as a replacement for Liverpool-bound Alberto Moreno.[16] He made ten appearances as they won the UEFA Europa League in his first season, including the 3–2 win over Dnipro in the final in Warsaw.[17] In May 2017, Trémoulinas announced he would leave the club upon the expiry of his contract.[18] On 14 February 2019, Trémoulinas announced his retirement as a professional player after struggling with knee injuries.[19] Trémoulinas was born in France and is of Indo-Reunnionais, and Malagasy descent.[20] On 5 August 2010, Trémoulinas was called up to the senior team for the first time by new manager Laurent Blanc for the team's friendly against Norway on 11 August 2010. However, he did not play that game but he was called up again more than two years after by Didier Deschamps for a friendly game against Italy scheduled on 15 November 2012 in which he replaced Moussa Sissoko at the 89th minute of the game achieving his first international selection.[citation needed] Bordeaux Dynamo Kyiv Sevilla Individual","Benoît Trémoulinas","[""Benoît

"74479",":Article","  Karen Louise Bardsley (born 14 October 1984) is an American-born English former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. She played for Sky Blue FC in the previous top-flight American Women's Professional Soccer league, Linköpings FC in the Swedish Damallsvenskan, Lincoln Ladies plus Manchester City in the FA WSL and OL Reign in the NWSL. She played for the England national team and Great Britain internationally. Born in Santa Monica, California to English parents, Bardsley grew up in the Los Angeles suburb of Chino Hills and began playing football at five years old.[2][3][4] She attended Ayala High School and played for the girls' varsity soccer team for two years. During her junior year, she broke her left leg during college recruitment time resulting in some programs reportedly being concerned about her recovery.[4] As a senior, she earned All-Sierra League honours and helped lead the team to win the league championship and reach the quarterfinals of the state playoffs.[5] She was named the Sierra League Most Valuable Player (MVP) the same year.[5] Bardsley also ran track, threw javelin and was a member of the Olympic Development Program at the regional, state, and national levels.[5] Bardsley attended California State University, Fullerton as a graphic design major and played for the Titans women's soccer team. Following her first season in 2002, she was named the Big West Conference Freshman of the Year after recording 88 saves with an .846 (84.6%) save percentage.[4] The following season, she played just 28 minutes before a broken leg during the Portland Nike Invitational and redshirted the 2003 season.[4] Despite missing eight games during the 2004 season due to injury recovery, Bardsley earned All-Big West First Team honours and was named Big West Conference Goalkeeper of the Year for the first of three consecutive seasons.[4] Her 0.71 goals against average ranked third in the league.[5] In 2005, Bardsley was named Big West Conference Goalkeeper of the Year and to the All-Big West First Team for the second consecutive season and set new single-season program records for goals against average (0.64), victories, and shutouts (10).[5] Her goals against average ranked 21st in the country and first in the Big West Conference.[5] During her senior season, she was named Big West Conference Goalkeeper of the Year for the third consecutive time and was named to the First-Team All-Big West Conference team.[5] She started all 22 matches and recorded a 12–8–2 record, including eight shutouts. Bardsley was named Player of the Week by the Big West Conference twice during the season.[5] Her 1.02 goals against average ranked fourth all-time at the school and her 128 saves ranked second in school history.[5] After college, Bardsley joined Ajax America Women for the 2007 WPSL season and played for Pali Blues during the 2008 W-League season.[6] The team went undefeated 14–0 and won the league championship.[7] Bardsley was selected by Sky Blue FC as a third-round pick in the 2009 WPS Draft ahead of the inaugural season of the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) league.[8] She competed in four games for the club in their 2009 season. Sky Blue finished the regular season in fourth place with a 7–8–5 record and advanced to the 2009 Women's Professional Soccer Playoffs where they defeated the Washington Freedom 2–1 and Saint Louis Athletica 1–0 during the semi-final.[9] After a 1–0 win against Los Angeles Sol, the team clinched the league championship and were later invited to the White House to be honoured by President Barack Obama.[10] During the 2010 WPS season, Bardsley competed in 10 matches recording 900 minutes in goal.[11] During a match against Atlanta in May 2010, she made 13 saves helping the team win 1–0. Sky Blue head coach Pauliina Miettinen reveled, ""As a team, it gives you a huge confidence boost when you know that you will get such a high level of play by your goalkeeper.""[12] She was named the WPS Player of the Month the same month.[13] During a training session in July 2010, Bardsley injured her clavicle when she led the league with five shutouts and a .90 goals against average (GAA).[13] The team finished in fifth place with a 7–10–7 record narrowly missing the WPS Playoffs.[14] During the 2011 WPS season, Bardsley competed in only three matches for Sky Blue largely due to her 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup commitments with the England national team. Sky Blue finished in fifth place with a 5–9–4 record.[15] In August 2011 Bardsley joined Swedish club Linköpings FC.[16] With Linköpings, Bardsley made three Damallsvenskan appearances in 2011, but none in 2012 as Sofia Lundgren remained the first choice goalkeeper.[17] During the 2011 season, the team finished in sixth place with a 9–5–8 record.[18] During the 2012 season, it finished in third place with a 11–5–6 record.[19] Bardsley announced a transfer to Lincoln Ladies of the FA WSL in November 2012 ahead of the 2013 FA WSL season.[20] She was the starting goalkeeper in all 14 matches. The team finished in sixth place with a 2–8–4 record.[21] Bardsley moved at the end of the 2013 season to Manchester City on a two-year deal.[22] Her two-year City stint started successfully, playing a pivotal role in the club winning the 2014 Continental Cup.[23] In March 2015, Bardsley was given a three-match ban for violent conduct in a 0–0 draw with Birmingham City after a fight with Birmingham City forward Freda Ayisi. Ayisi was expelled from the match immediately by the referee's red card.[24] She later stated, ""Passions ran high against Birmingham. Viewing the footage again, I regret the incident with Freda Ayisi. Whilst I was provoked, it was out of character for me to react in that way. I've contacted Birmingham to apologise for my involvement.""[25] During the 2017–18 and 2018–19 seasons, despite being first choice in the England national side, Bardsley lost her starting position for Manchester City to English teenager Ellie Roebuck. At the start of the following season, it was announced that Bardsley would miss the 2019 Women's International Champions Cup due to a hamstring injury.[26][27] She made her 100th appearance in a Continental Cup match against Liverpool in November 2020.[28] Bardsley announced her retirement on 2 May 2022 after suffering a long-term injury that forced her to withdraw from Great Britain's squad during the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics.[29][30] The 37 year old earned 82 caps for England, while she won 8 major trophies with Manchester City.[31][32] Despite being born in the United States, as a dual citizen, Bardsley decided to represent England due to family connections in Stockport.[33] She appeared for the England U-19s in the 2003 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship.[34] She made her senior debut in the Algarve Cup in March 2005, where England beat Northern Ireland 4–0. In August 2009, she was named to coach Hope Powell's squad for UEFA Women's Euro 2009.[35] By the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany, Bardsley had taken over the national team's first choice goalkeeping position from Rachel Brown.[36] After England's 1–1 opening group match draw with Mexico, coach Powell reported that Bardsley was ""devastated"" following the concession of a long-range equaliser to Mónica Ocampo.[37] In England's quarter final exit to France, Bardsley saved the first penalty in the shootout, but misses from Claire Rafferty and Faye White sent England home.[38] In June 2012 Bardsley was named in the 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[39] She played in all four games as Great Britain were beaten 2–0 by Canada in the last eight.[40] At UEFA Women's Euro 2013 England lost 3–2 to Spain in their opening game, when Spain scored a 94th-minute goal,[41][42] and were knocked out in the first round. Hope Powell was sacked in the wake of that failure but new coach Mark Sampson continued to select Bardsley. In May 2015, Bardsley was named to England's final squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, hosted in Canada.[43] Bardsley had previously played as goalkeeper in all five games and was part of the history-making team which beat Norway in the round of 16 to become the first senior England women's team to win a world cup knockout match. She was substituted in the 51st minute of the quarter-final match against Canada,[44] after suffering an inflammation of her right eye; she was immediately taken off pitch with her eye visibly swollen and was substituted with Siobhan Chamberlain. The reasoning for the swelling was unknown, but parts of the artificial turf were suspected.[45] Bardsley played in England's first two Group games (against Scotland and Spain) but was rested in the final Group game against Portugal. She suffered a fractured fibula in England's quarter-final against France and did not take any further part in the tournament.[46][47] On 8 May 2019, she was named in the squad for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. She played in two of the matches in the group stage, against Scotland[48] and Japan. She played in the round of 16 against Cameroon[49] and in the quarter-final against Norway.[50] Bardsley was allotted 161 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[51][52] Bardsley began coaching as a volunteer coach at her alma mater, California State University, Fullerton, before being employed as an assistant coach with the University of San Diego.[53] She graduated with a Master's degree in Sports Directorship at the Manchester Metropolitan University in July 2019.[54] Manchester City[55] England","Karen

Smith's first goal in his second stint at the Stones came on 2 March 2021, against his former side Boreham Wood in a 1–0 victory.[17] On 4 June 2021 it was announced that Smith had left the club.[18] In June 2021, Smith returned to Boreham Wood to take on a player/first team coach role.[19] On 12 July 2022, Smith signed for Barnet on a two-year contract.[20] Following the departure of John Dreyer, he became assistant manager at the Bees.[21] AFC Wimbledon Wealdstone","Connor Smith","[""Connor Michael Smith"",""Barnet"",""side"",""National League"",""midfielder"",""Watford"",""Wealdstone"",""AFC Wimbledon"",""prominence"",""Irish"",""runner-up"",""television show"",""academy setup"",""side"",""goal"",""Ireland"",""Ben Greenhalgh"",""Football's Next Star."",""side"",""contract"",""club"",""loan"",""loan"",""contract"",""side"",""contract"",""side"",""Isthmian League"",""loan"",""debut"",""consent"",""promotion"",""goal"",""victory"",""end"",""substitute"",""tie"",""release"",""Britt Assombalonga."",""season"",""promotion"",""Boreham Wood."",""Plymouth"",""part"",""League Two"",""stint"",""Yeovil Town"",""Stevenage"",""Dons"",""Crystal Palace"",""Sean Murray"",""Football League Championship"",""Gillingham"",""Plymouth Argyle."",""team coach role."",""assistant manager"",""League One"",""EFL Trophy"",""games"",""player"",""departure"",""contract"",""Stones"",""time"",""John Dreyer"",""Bees."",""club."",""Billericay Town"",""2016"",""19"",""November 2011"",""January 2012"",""May 2012"",""18 August 2012"",""8 January 2014"",""2013"",""1 September 2015"",""21 January 2016"",""4 October 2016"",""18 February 1993"",""5 July 2018"",""6 July 2018"",""4 January 2019"",""2019"",""2020"",""2 March 2021"",""4 June 2021"",""June 2021"",""12 July 2022"",""6"",""20"",""21"",""0"",""4"",""20"",""2"",""18"",""16"",""two"",""2022"",""3"",""7"",""18"",""13"",""1993"",""2018"",""2015"",""2011"",""2016"",""2018"",""2012"",""12"",""Two"",""two"",""17"",""2"",""2019"",""21"",""18"",""2016"",""15"",""2021"",""4"",""2014"",""2016"",""9"",""11"",""14"",""10"",""Two"",""One"",""8"",""17"",""5"",""2020"",""2010"",""14"",""2021"",""6"",""2021"",""2012"",""2012"",""12"",""18"",""two"",""4"",""8"",""2019"",""4"",""2019"",""1"",""1"",""5"",""2"",""two"",""3"",""2013"",""11"",""2010""]","0.0014732043542922556","true","[0.7086763,0.074561164,0.020807123,0.014136275,0.01344012,0.011895371,0.009786794,0.009346768,0.008084485,0.007979852,0.006484697,0.006484697,0.005462706,0.004781542,0.0038502766,0.0038399994,0.0038399994,0.0038399994,0.0038296655,0.0038296655,0.0037819317,0.003296118,0.003296118,0.002604033,0.002604033,0.0025948437,0.002374426,0.0023524025,0.0022135065,0.0019235992,0.0019032857,0.0019025583,0.0018913681,0.0018894222,0.0018800254,0.0016596818,0.0015243316,0.0015243316,0.0014543508,0.001433786,0.0014305738,0.0014124889,0.0013165313,0.001249166,0.0012097082,0.0011439056,9.931313E-4,9.882068E-4,9.820139E-4,9.810027E-4,9.810027E-4,9.810027E-4,9.7611966E-4,9.410992E-4,9.166162E-4,9.1146486E-4,9.009538E-4,9.009538E-4,8.1382715E-4,8.005488E-4,8.005488E-4,7.847447E-4,6.7600596E-4,5.0352345E-4,4.7303314E-4,4.7303314E-4,4.287743E-4,3.7141182E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Connor Smith (footballer, born 1993) - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Smith_(footballer,_born_1993)",,,,,,,
"74481",":Article","  Manuel Almunia Rivero (born 19 May 1977) is a Spanish former footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He competed mainly in the Spanish lower leagues in his early years, only appearing in 26 La Liga games over the course of two seasons with Recreativo and Albacete, after starting out at Osasuna. Most of his professional career was spent with Arsenal, for whom he signed in 2004, going on to play 175 official matches and winning the 2005 FA Cup.[5] He also had a short loan spell at West Ham United. In 2012, after his contract expired, Almunia joined Watford and played there for two years, following which he retired on medical advice. Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Almunia started his senior career with Osasuna's reserves in 1995, going on to spend four seasons with the team in the Segunda División B. Subsequently, he stayed in the same level, where he represented Cartagonova and Sabadell. In the summer of 2001, Almunia first reached La Liga, after signing with Celta Vigo. He never represented the club officially, however, being loaned to Eibar[6] (where he won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in the Segunda División for the 2001–02 campaign),[7] Recreativo[8] and Albacete, the last two in the top flight.[9] Playing understudy to José Antonio Luque and César at Recre,[10] Almunia's debut in the Spanish top tier came on 17 November 2002, following a red card to the latter in a 3–0 away loss against Alavés.[11] It was one of only two league appearances during the season, as the Andalusians suffered relegation after ranking 18th.[10] At Albacete, Almunia started as backup to Carlos Roa. However, after the Argentine came down with illness he became first-choice,[12] going on to help his team easily escape relegation through a 14th-place finish;[13] his first league appearance was on 9 November 2003, in a 1–0 home defeat to Málaga as Roa was suspended.[14] Almunia joined Arsenal on 14 July 2004 for an undisclosed sum, to provide backup to Jens Lehmann.[15] He made his debut for his new team on 27 October in a 2–1 win at Manchester City in that season's League Cup,[16] and his maiden Premier League appearance came on 4 December against Birmingham City;[17] the highlight of his first year came in the fifth round of the FA Cup, a replay at Sheffield United: with the game finishing 0–0 after extra time and heading to penalties, he saved Alan Quinn and Jon Harley's attempts to book his team a place in the quarter-finals,[18] and was an unused substitute in the final win over Manchester United. In the 2005–06 campaign, Almunia continued as second-choice to Lehmann, but found himself thrust into the spotlight when he replaced Robert Pires in the 20th minute of the final of the UEFA Champions League against Barcelona after Lehmann was sent off. He performed well for the most part, only conceding both goals in the 2–1 loss late in the game.[19] 2006–07 brought Almunia 14 appearances in all competitions. This included the League Cup final, lost to Chelsea.[20] He and Lehmann were by all accounts rivals off the pitch as well. In an interview with German television in October 2007, speaking about manager Arsène Wenger's decision to drop him in favour of the Spaniard, Lehmann said: ""It’s possible that some day I’ll feel like talking about the whole issue. But at the moment I’m just swallowing it all as part of the humiliation. But I think – and this is aimed at my dear manager – one shouldn’t humiliate players for too long. I won’t just fade away quietly. Almunia has not yet showed he can win matches for us. I’ve experienced this before and know what the others are expecting from the goalkeeper"". Five months later, Almunia responded: ""I treat people the way I would like to be treated myself. To have someone here who hates me is just amazing. Every morning I wake up I know it is going to be the same. But I don’t care any more. I come into training and work with Łukasz Fabiański and Vito Mannone. They are better than him anyway"".[21] Almunia finally won the battle for first-choice duties in the 2007–08 season. Highlights included saving a penalty from Robbie Keane to help Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–1.[22] He was given the number one shirt after Lehmann left for Stuttgart at the beginning of the 2008–09 campaign, and he saved another important penalty on 21 March 2009, this time from Newcastle United's Obafemi Martins in a 3–1 victory.[23] In June 2008 he signed a new four-year contract with the English club,[24] but his subsequent performances were highly inconsistent, with brilliant displays in the Champions League semi-final first leg against Manchester United[25] and the 2010 Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona,[26] and poorly received ones which resulted in rumours arising that he would be sold.[27] Despite the speculation, Almunia began 2010–11 as starter. However, on 25 September against West Bromwich Albion, he conceded a penalty (which he saved), let a weak shot slip through the near post and was caught out of position in the opposition's third goal;[28] he lost his place through injury and, upon his return, found himself third-choice behind the Polish duo of Fabiański and Wojciech Szczęsny. Almunia made a return to the team on 30 January 2011 against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup,[29] and went on to play both games in the next round against Leyton Orient.[30][31] On 8 March, he came on as a 19th-minute substitute for the injured Szczęsny against Barcelona in the Champions League last-16 stage, and made a series of saves as Arsenal lost 3–1 at the Camp Nou to exit the tournament, 4–3 on aggregate; he was voted Player of the match by fans on the club's official website.[32] With Szczęsny (dislocated finger), Fabianski (shoulder) and Mannone all out with injury, Almunia again became first-choice. On 19 March, during a 2–2 draw at West Bromwich, he was caught out of position along with Sébastien Squillaci, gifting the home team their second goal;[33] already with Lehmann back in the club as an emergency signing, he injured his knee during warm-up of the fixture against Blackpool,[34] and did not appear in any more matches for the rest of the season. On 30 September 2011, Almunia signed an initial one-month emergency loan deal with Championship club West Ham United after Robert Green was ruled out for six weeks with a knee cartilage injury.[35] He made his debut for the Hammers on 1 October in a 2–2 away draw against Crystal Palace[36] but, at the end of October and with Green's return to fitness, he returned to Arsenal.[37] On 22 May 2012, Arsenal announced that Almunia and six other players would be released from their contracts as of 30 June.[38] In July 2012, aged 35, Almunia signed a one-year contract with Championship's Watford, replacing Scott Loach who had moved to Ipswich Town.[39] He played his first game on 11 August in a League Cup tie at home to Wycombe Wanderers, and kept a clean sheet.[40] Having appeared in all thirty four of Watford's league games, Almunia injured his hamstring against Derby County on 23 February 2013. He missed the next six contests as youngster Jonathan Bond deputised in his absence,[41] returning in a 0–0 home draw against Cardiff City on 6 April 2013.[42] On 12 May 2013, in the play-off semi-final second leg at home to Leicester City, Almunia made a double save from Anthony Knockaert's penalty in injury time, with Watford leading 2–1 but still level on aggregate. Watford counter-attacked from the resulting saves and Troy Deeney's goal to put his team in the decisive match against Crystal Palace, where a Kevin Phillips penalty in extra time resulted in a 1–0 loss.[43] Watford announced that Almunia had signed a new twelve-month deal on 5 July 2013, to keep him at the club for one further season. Manager Gianfranco Zola commented: ""His experience and influence are so important for us and the impact he had at Watford last season was magnificent.""[44] He left in June of the following year, as his link expired.[45] Almunia retired on 28 August 2014 on medical advice, after a rare heart condition was picked up during a medical with Serie A side Cagliari.[46] In 2016, he was appointed to the role of goalkeeping coach at UAE Pro League club Al Jazira.[47] Almunia did not represent Spain at any level. He stated on more than one occasion his desire to play for England, only provided that he did not receive a call-up from his nation of birth first.[48][49] Almunia, whose brother served in the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations in Kosovo, has an interest in the Second World War and regularly visited sites associated with the conflict before European games with Arsenal.[50][51][52] Arsenal Individual","Manuel Almunia","[""Manuel Almunia Rivero"",""Recreativo"",""Arsenal"",""advice"",""goalkeeper"",""level"",""Eibar"",""Spanish"",""Barcelona"",""West Ham United"",""leagues"",""team"",""seasons"",""games"",""team"",""contract"",""Watford"",""campaign"",""club"",""Crystal Palace"",""career"",""Most"",""career"",""Albacete"",""course"",""loan spell"",""reserves"",""UEFA Champions League"",""penalty"",""game."",""League Cup"",""Osasuna"",""La Liga"",""Segunda División B.

"74483",":Article","    Argentine professional footballer Eponyms and public art Media Family Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] ( Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ⓘ; born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (eight), and most assists in La Liga (192) and the Copa América (17). He also has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club (672). Messi relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice. Messi joined American club Inter Miami in July 2023, winning the Leagues Cup in August of that year. An Argentine international, Messi is the country's all-time leading goalscorer and also holds the national record for appearances. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup (2006), and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, the 2015 Copa América, winning the Golden Ball, and the 2016 Copa América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa América, and victory in the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot for the latter. That same year, Messi received a seventh Ballon d'Or. In 2022, he led Argentina to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup, where he won a record second Golden Ball, scored seven goals including two in the final, and broke the record for most games played at the World Cup (26), later receiving his record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or in 2023. Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, with Messi being the first team-sport athlete to win the award. In 2020, Messi became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings. Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[10] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, ""Leo"" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[11] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[12] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.[13][14] ""When you saw him you would think: this kid can't play ball. He's a dwarf, he's too fragile, too small. But immediately you'd realise that he was born different, that he was a phenomenon and that he was going to be something impressive."" – Newell's Old Boys youth coach Adrián Coria shares his first impression of the 12-year-old Messi.[15] A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of ""The Machine of '87"", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[16][17] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, aged 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[18] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, whom he idolised.[19][20] It was speculated that he failed to be signed into River Plate due to his ill health, however in a 2019 interview, Messi revealed that the club had offered to pay for his medical treatment despite ultimately rejecting him.[21] His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him ""the best forward I've ever seen"".[22] As the Messi family had relatives in Catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][23] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and little sister, María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.[16][23][24] After a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué.[25] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[26] Messi became an integral part of the ""Baby Dream Team"", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002–03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[25][27] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4–1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la máscara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution.[28] At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while Fàbregas and Piqué soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona.[23][29][30] ""It seemed as if he had been playing with us all his life."" – Barcelona's then assistant coach Henk ten Cate on Messi's first-team debut.[31] During the 2003–04 season Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for four youth teams in a single campaign.[32] After being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he was soon promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.[33][34] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen Frank Rijkaard's depleted first team during the international break. French winger Ludovic Giuly notes that Messi stood out in first team training sessions: ""He destroyed us all... Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.""[35] Messi made his first team debut as a 75th-minute substitute during a friendly against Porto on 16 November 2003.[23][36] His performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, Barcelona B, as well as weekly with the first team.[37] Barcelona's new star player, Ronaldinho, believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself;[38] he soon befriended Messi, whom he called ""little brother"", and eased his transition into the first team.[39][40] To gain further match experience, Messi played for Barcelona C, helping to save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera División by scoring five goals in ten games.[41] He signed his first professional contract, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of €30 million, on 4 February 2004; this automatically increased to €80 million when he made his debut for Barcelona B on 6 March.[42] He played five games with the B team that season but did not score.[43] Physically weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, he worked on increasing his strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. He finished the campaign with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.[41] During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a guaranteed starter for the B team, playing 17 games and scoring on six occasions.[38][44] He was not called up to the first team until the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him in October 2004.[38] Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved the initially-unwilling Messi onto the right, allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.[45][46] He made his league debut as a late substitute against Espanyol on 16 October.[23] At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition.[40] As a substitute, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk.[44] He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club.[45][47] That season, Barcelona won the league for the first time in six years.[48] ""In my entire life I have never seen a player of such quality and personality at such a young age, particularly wearing the 'heavy' shirt of one of the world's great clubs."" – Fabio Capello praises the 18-year-old Messi following the Joan Gamper trophy in August 2005.[49] On his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first senior contract, which increased his buyout clause to €150 million and tied him to the club until 2010.[50] On 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, he started for the first time and gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[49] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[51] Messi seriously considered the offer but ultimately decided to stay.[52] On 16 September, his contract was extended to 2014.[50][53] Due to issues regarding his legal status, Messi missed the start of the 2005–06 La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[53][54] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o;[30][55][56] he was in the starting line-up in major matches such as his first Clásico against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November.[57] Messi scored eight goals in twenty-five games, including, against Panathinaikos, his first in the Champions League,[58][59] but suffered a torn hamstring against Chelsea on 7 March 2006. His participation in the Champions League final was ruled out on the day, and he was so disappointed that he refused to celebrate his team's victory over Arsenal in Paris.[55][60] While Barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old Messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006–07 campaign.[61][62] Already an idol to the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions.[62][63] However, he sustained a metatarsal fracture on 12 November and was injured for three months.[64][65] He recovered in time for the Champions League last 16 round against Liverpool, but Barcelona lost and were knocked out.[66] In the league, 11 of his 14 goals came from his last 13 games;[63] on 10 March 2007, he became the first player in twelve years to score a hat-trick in a Clásico, which ended in a 3–3 draw.[67] His growing importance to the club was reflected that month in a new contract which greatly increased his wages.[68] Already frequently compared to compatriot Diego Maradona, Messi nearly replicated Maradona's two most famous goals in the span of seven weeks.[69] During a Copa del Rey semi-final against Getafe on 18 April, he scored a goal remarkably similar to Maradona's Goal of the Century, by collecting the ball near the halfway line, running 60 metres (66 yd), and beating five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as Maradona had done;[19][70] against Espanyol on 9 June, he scored with his hand in similar fashion to Maradona's Hand of God goal.[71] Barcelona faltered that season, failing to reach the Copa del Rey final and losing the league to Real Madrid.[72][73] After Ronaldinho lost form, Messi became Barça's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname ""Messiah"" from the Spanish media.[19][74][75] He was voted the third-best player of the year in the 2007 Ballon d'Or, behind Kaká and runner-up Cristiano Ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the FIFA World Player of the Year award, again behind Kaká.[76][77] Although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007–08 campaign,[78] the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 December.[79] Returning against Celtic in the Champions League last 16 round, he reinjured himself during the return leg, which Rijkaard had selected him for against the medical staff's wishes; captain Carles Puyol criticised the Spanish media for pressuring Messi to play every match.[79] Barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the Champions League by Manchester United, and placed third in the league.[80] After two unsuccessful seasons, Rijkaard and Ronaldinho departed from Barclona. In the latter's wake, Messi was given the number 10 shirt,[56] and signed a new contract with an annual salary of €7.8 million, becoming the club's highest-paid player.[81][82] He and the club implemented strategies to combat his frequent muscular injuries, which ensured he would remain virtually injury-free during the next four years.[65][83] His performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times behind Cristiano Ronaldo.[76][84] In his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008–09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games.[85][86] Under Barcelona's new manager Pep Guardiola, Messi played mainly on the right wing as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside. During the Clásico on 2 May 2009, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with Xavi and Andrés Iniesta. He set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6–2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.[87][88] He then scored once and assisted a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4–1 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi, Barcelona became La Liga champions.[85][90] The season's Champions League top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history,[91] Messi returned as a false nine for the final on 27 May against Manchester United, in which he scored once; Barcelona won 2–0 and achieved the first treble by a Spanish team.[92] On 18 September, he signed a new contract which increased his salary to €12 million and committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a buyout clause of €250 million.[81] In the second half of 2009, Barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year;[93] after winning the Supercopa de España and UEFA Super Cup in August, Messi scored the winning goal to claim the FIFA Club World Cup on 19 December.[94] At 22 years old, Messi won both the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award by the biggest voting margin in each trophy's history.[76] Unsatisfied with his position on the right wing – with Zlatan Ibrahimović now occupying the central forward role – Messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010. He soon effectively became the tactical focal point of Guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased.[95] ""Messi is the best player in the world by some distance. He's [like] a PlayStation. He can take advantage of every mistake we make."" – Arsène Wenger commends Messi for his four-goal display against Arsenal in April 2010.[96] Messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equalling Ronaldo's club record from the 1996–97 campaign.[97][98] He became Barcelona's all-time Champions League top scorer by scoring all four of his side's goals in the quarter-final against Arsenal on 6 April.[99] Although Barcelona were eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Inter Milan, Messi's eight goals meant he was the competition's top scorer for a consecutive year.[100] As the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying Ronaldo's record), he helped Barcelona win a second consecutive La Liga trophy with only a single defeat and earned his first European Golden Shoe.[98][101] Messi secured Barcelona's first trophy of the 2010–11 campaign, the Supercopa de España, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4–0 victory over Sevilla.[102] He was again instrumental in a Clásico on 29 November 2010 as Barcelona defeated their rivals 5–0.[103] Messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in Spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against Atlético Madrid on 5 February 2011.[104][105] His club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with Argentina at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[76][106] Towards the end of the season, Messi played a prominent role in the Champions League semi-final victory against Real Madrid, scoring two goals, the second of which was highly acclaimed, in the first leg.[107][108][109] Messi gave a man-of-the-match performance in the Champions League final against Manchester United on 28 May, scoring the match-winning goal of Barça's 3–1 victory, and becoming the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year.[110][111] Barcelona won a third consecutive La Liga title, with Messi scoring 31 and assisting 18 goals.[112][113] He finished the season with 53 goals in all competitions, the highest in Spanish football history.[112][114] As Messi developed into a combination of a creator and scorer,[115] he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011–12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions.[116][117][118] He began the campaign by helping Barcelona win both the Spanish and European Super Cups, the first with a hat-trick.[119][120] At the close of the year, on 18 December, he scored twice in the FIFA Club World Cup final, a 4–0 victory over Santos.[121] He again received the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the Ballon d'Or three times.[122] Additionally, he won the inaugural UEFA Best Player in Europe Award, a revival of the old-style Ballon d'Or.[123] Messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like Diego Maradona and Pelé.[24] On 7 March 2012, Messi scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the UEFA Champions League era.[124][125] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[126] Barcelona's era of greatness under Guardiola was however drawing to an end.[127] Although Guardiola's Barcelona won their 14th trophy in the Copa del Rey against Athletic Bilbao, the team lost the league to Real Madrid and was eliminated in the Champions League semi-finals by Chelsea, with Messi missing a crucial penalty.[128][129] In Barcelona's last home league match on 5 May, Messi scored all four goals before embracing Guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager.[130] He finished the season as league top scorer in Europe again, with a La Liga record of 50 goals, while his 73 goals in all competitions made him the single-season top scorer in European history.[131][132] Under manager Tito Vilanova who had first coached him at La Masia, Messi became Barcelona's all-time top scorer in La Liga with 191 goals, and broke the record of most goals scored in a calendar year, previously set by Gerd Müller in 1972.[133] At the close of the year, Messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for Barcelona and Argentina.[134] Messi again won the FIFA Ballon d'Or, becoming the only player in history to win the Ballon d'Or four times.[134][135] Barcelona had virtually secured their La Liga title by the start of 2013. However, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012–13 campaign, with Vilanova absent due to ill health.[136] They were nearly eliminated in the Champions League first knockout round by AC Milan, but two goals and an assist from Messi secured a second-leg comeback.[137] Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018 with annual wages of €13 million.[138][139] He wore the captain's armband for the first time on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; the team's tactical focal point, more than 40% of Barcelona goals that season involved him, up from 24% three years earlier.[140][141] ""In Leo we are talking about the best player in the world and when things are not going well you have to use him. Even if he is half lame, his presence on the pitch is enough to lift us and our play in general."" – Defender Gerard Piqué explains Barcelona's reliance on an unfit Messi against Paris Saint-Germain in April 2013.[142] After four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions.[143] These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.[143] Messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist.[144] Further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 May ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against Osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in La Liga.[145][146] With 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in La Liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in Spain and Europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the European Golden Shoe three times.[147][148] Following an irregular start to the new season under manager Gerardo Martino, formerly of his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys, Messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 November, leaving him sidelined for two months.[149][150] Despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to Cristiano Ronaldo.[151] During the second half of the 2013–14 season, doubts persisted over Messi's form, leading to a perception among the culés that he was reserving himself for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons.[152][153] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara's 369 goals to become Barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[152][154] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[153][155] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[156] After prolonged speculation over his future with the club, Messi signed a new contract on 19 May 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to €20 million, or €36 million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.[157] It was reported that Vilanova played a key role in convincing Messi to stay[158] amid strong interest from José Mourinho's Chelsea.[159] Under new manager and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year.[160] A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra.[161] A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the Derbi barceloní with 12 goals.[162] Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.[163] At the start of 2015, Barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that Messi was leaving the club. A turning point came on 11 January during a 3–1 victory over Atlético Madrid, the first time Barça's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed ""MSN"", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[164][165] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Suárez, their striker.[165][166] From there, he regained his best form, while Suárez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[167][168] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[169] Towards the end of the campaign, Messi scored in a 1–0 away win over Atlético Madrid on 17 May, securing the La Liga title.[170] Among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against Rayo Vallecano on 8 March, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for Barcelona, allowing him to overtake Telmo Zarra with the most hat-tricks in Spanish football.[171] As the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed Luís Figo with the most assists in La Liga;[note 4] he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against Levante on 15 February, in which he also scored a hat-trick.[172][173][174] Messi scored twice as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 3–1 in the Copa del Rey final on 30 May, achieving the sixth double in their history. His opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.[175] In the Champions League, Messi scored twice and set up another in their 3–0 semi-final victory over Bayern Munich, now under the stewardship of Guardiola.[176] His second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after his dribble past Jérôme Boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by UEFA.[177][178] Despite a second-leg loss, Barcelona progressed to the final on 6 June in Berlin, where they defeated Juventus 3–1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so.[179][180] Although Messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon from which Suárez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound.[169] In addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, Messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five Champions League seasons.[181][182] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe award for a second time.[183] Messi opened the 2015–16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in Barcelona's 5–4 victory (after extra time) over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[184] On 16 September, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the UEFA Champions League in a 1–1 away draw to Roma.[185] After a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 November, making a substitute appearance in Barcelona's 4–0 away win over rivals Real Madrid in El Clásico.[186] Messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona defeated River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama.[187] On 30 December, Messi scored on his 500th appearance for Barcelona, in a 4–0 home win over Real Betis.[188] On 11 January 2016, Messi won the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a record fifth time in his career.[189] On 3 February, he scored a hat-trick in Barcelona's 7–0 win against Valencia in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final at the Camp Nou.[190] In a 6–1 home win against Celta Vigo in the league, Messi assisted Suárez from a penalty kick. Some saw it as ""a touch of genius"", while others criticised it as being disrespectful to the opponent. The Celta players never complained and their coach defended the penalty, stating, ""Barca's forwards are very respectful."" The penalty routine has been compared to that of Barça icon Johan Cruyff in 1982, who was battling lung cancer, leading many fans to indicate that the penalty was a tribute to him. Cruyff himself was ""very happy"" with the play, insisting ""it was legal and entertaining"".[191][192] On 17 February, Messi reached his 300th league goal in a 3–1 away win against Sporting de Gijón.[193] A few days later, he scored both goals in Barcelona's 2–0 win against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, in the first leg of the 2015–16 UEFA Champions League round of 16, with the second goal being Barcelona's 10,000th in official competitions.[194] On 17 April, Messi ended a five-match scoring drought with his 500th senior career goal for club and country in Barcelona's 2–1 home loss to Valencia.[195] Messi finished the 2015–16 season by setting up both goals in Barcelona's 2–0 extra time win over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey final, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, on 22 May 2016, as the club celebrated winning the domestic double for the second consecutive season.[196] In total, Messi scored 41 goals as Barcelona's attacking trio managed a Spanish record of 131 goals throughout the season, breaking the record they had set the previous season.[197] ""[Messi] is indispensable, but the rest of us are dispensable. – No, the club is bigger than any manager, than any player... except Leo. That's the reality, and you have to accept it."" – In an interview with Barcelona's official magazine, Javier Mascherano outlines Messi's importance to the team.[198] Messi opened the 2016–17 season by lifting the 2016 Supercopa de España as Barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured Andrés Iniesta;[199] he set-up Munir's goal in a 2–0 away win over Sevilla in the first leg on 14 August,[200] and subsequently scored in a 3–0 win in the return leg on 17 August.[201] Three days later, he scored two goals as Barcelona won 6–2 against Real Betis in the opening game of the 2016–17 La Liga season.[202] On 13 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League campaign against Celtic in a 7–0 victory; this was also Messi's sixth hat-trick in the Champions League, the most by any player.

The game ended in a penalty shoot-out which Miami won, 10–9, with Messi scoring the first, giving the club their first ever trophy.[367] Messi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2–0 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[368] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[369] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[370] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1–0 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[371] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[372] For his achievements in 2023, he was named Time Athlete of the Year, the first footballer to ever win the award.[373] On 15 January 2024, Messi won The Best FIFA Men's Player for a record third time.[374] He also extended his record number of appearances in the FIFPRO Men's World 11 to 17 straight appearances, having not missed out on the selection since 2006.[375] As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[376] Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach, alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the Argentine Football Association organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in FIFA. Five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 June, he made his debut for his country against Paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8–0 victory. He was subsequently included in the squad for the South American Youth Championship, held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. After being named man of the match against Venezuela, he scored the winning 2–1 goal in the crucial last match against Brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship.[377] Aware of his physical limitations, Messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals.[378][379] His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.[379] In recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager José Pékerman gave Messi his first call-up for a friendly against Hungary on 17 August 2005. Aged 18, Messi made his senior debut for Argentina in the Ferenc Puskás Stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against Vilmos Vanczák, who had grabbed his shirt; Messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision.[380] Messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off.[381] He returned to the team on 3 September in their World Cup qualifier defeat to Paraguay, which he had declared his ""re-debut"" ahead of the match.[382] Messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against Peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. After the match, Pékerman described him as ""a jewel"".[383] He subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of Argentina's participation in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006.[384] A hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the World Cup, but he was nevertheless selected for Pékerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.[385] During the World Cup in Germany, Messi witnessed their opening match victory against the Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the World Cup.[386] As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential.[387][388] In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed.[389][390] He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout.[391] Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.[392][393] As Messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela.[62][394] He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia.[395][396] At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win.[394] In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players.[397] Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme.[394] He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.[398] Ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Barcelona legally barred Messi from representing Argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their Champions League qualifying matches.[399] After interference from newly appointed Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, Messi was permitted to join Sergio Batista's under-23 squad in Beijing.[400] During the first match, he scored the opening goal in their 2–1 victory over the Ivory Coast. Following a 1–0 win in the next group match against Australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, Messi was rested during the game against Serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. Against the Netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2–1 win in extra time. After a 3–0 semi-final victory over Brazil, Messi assisted the only goal in the final as Argentina defeated Nigeria to claim Olympic gold medals.[401] Along with Riquelme, Messi was singled out by FIFA as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.[402] From late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances.[394] Under manager Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to World Cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 World Cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating Uruguay 1–0 in their last qualifying match. Maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing Messi out of his usual position. In eight qualifying matches under Maradona's stewardship, Messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4–0 victory over Venezuela.[384][403] During that game, played on 28 March 2009, he wore Argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of Riquelme.[404] Overall, Messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process.[384] Ahead of the tournament, Maradona visited Messi in Barcelona to request his tactical input; Messi then outlined a 4–3–1–2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the enganche in Argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.[405] Despite their poor qualifying campaign, Argentina were considered title contenders at the World Cup in South Africa. At the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; Messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by Nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1–0 win. During the next match, against South Korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4–1 victory. As their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but Messi reportedly refused to be benched.[403] He wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2–0 win against Greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see Argentina finish as group winners.[406] Argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against Germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. Their 4–0 loss was their worst margin of defeat at a World Cup since 1974.[407] FIFA subsequently identified Messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his ""outstanding"" pace and creativity and ""spectacular and efficient"" dribbling, shooting and passing.[408] Back home, however, Messi was the subject of harsher judgement. As the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as Maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at Barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.[409] Maradona was replaced by Sergio Batista, who had orchestrated Argentina's Olympic victory. Batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around Messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4–3–3 system, as used to much success by Barcelona.[409][410] Although Messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010–11 club season, he had not scored for Argentina in an official match since March 2009.[112][384] Despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 Copa América, hosted by Argentina. Their first two matches, against Bolivia and Colombia, ended in draws. Media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker Carlos Tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the Argentine public; Messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. During the crucial next match, with Tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3–0 victory over Costa Rica. After the quarter-final against Uruguay ended in a 1–1 draw following extra time, with Messi having assisted their equaliser, Argentina were eliminated 4–5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.[409] After Argentina's unsuccessful performance in the Copa América, Batista was replaced by Alejandro Sabella. Upon his appointment in August 2011, Sabella awarded the 24-year-old Messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain Javier Mascherano. Reserved by nature, Messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while Mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator.[411][412] In a further redesign of the team, Sabella dismissed Tevez and brought in players with whom Messi had won the World Youth Championship and Olympic Games. Now playing in a free role in an improving team, Messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first World Cup qualifying match against Chile on 7 October, his first official goal for Argentina in two-and-a-half years.[384][411] Under Sabella, Messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years.[384][411] He netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for Argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by Gabriel Batistuta for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country.[413] His first international hat-trick came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala. Messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 World Cup with a 5–2 victory over Paraguay on 10 September 2013 when he scored twice from penalty kicks, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become Argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind Batistuta. Overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign.[384][414] Concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in Argentina.[411] Ahead of the World Cup in Brazil, doubts persisted over Messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with Barcelona. At the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches.[415] In his first World Cup match as captain, he led them to a 2–1 victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina; he helped create Sead Kolašinac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first World Cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier.[416] During the second match against Iran, he scored an injury-time goal from 25 yards out to end the game in a 1–0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase.[417] He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[418] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[419][420] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team's first penalty.[421] Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[422] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup.[423] At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition.[415][424] However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.[425] Another final appearance, the third of Messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 Copa América, held in Chile. Under the stewardship of former Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino, Argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the World Cup.[426][427] During the opening match against Paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2–2 draw; Messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament.[428] Following a 1–0 win against defending champions Uruguay, Messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1–0 win over Jamaica, becoming only the fifth Argentine to achieve this milestone.[429] In his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for Argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.[384][429] As Messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led Argentina to the knockout stage as group winners.[430] In the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by Messi, but were repeatedly denied by Colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5–4 penalty shootout in their favour, with Messi netting his team's first spot kick.[431] At the semi-final stage, Messi excelled as a playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6–1 victory over Paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd.[430] Argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by Chile 4–1 in a penalty shootout after a 0–0 extra-time draw. Faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, Messi played below his standards, though he was the only Argentine to successfully convert his penalty.[432] At the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the Most Valuable Player award but rejected the honour.[433] As Argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the World Cup and Copa América defeats again brought intense criticism for Messi from Argentine media and fans.[434] Messi's place in Argentina's Copa América Centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1–0 friendly win over Honduras in a pre-Copa América warm-up match on 27 May 2016.[435] It was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. He was later left on the bench in Argentina's 2–1 opening win over defending champions Chile on 6 June due to concerns regarding his fitness.[436] Although Messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against Panama on 10 June, Martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced Augusto Fernández in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to Sergio Agüero's goal, as the match ended in a 5–0 victory, sealing Argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition;[437] he was elected man of the match for his performance.[438] ""Did it annoy me that Messi took the record? A little, yes. You go around the world and people say, 'he's the top scorer for the Argentina national team.' But the advantage I have is that I'm second to an extraterrestrial."" – Gabriel Batistuta on the consolation of Messi breaking his record.[439] On 18 June, in the quarter-final of the Copa América against Venezuela, Messi produced another man of the match performance,[440] assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4–1 victory, which enabled him to equal Gabriel Batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches.[441] This record was broken three days later when Messi scored a free kick in a 4–0 semi-final win against hosts the United States; he also assisted two goals during the match as Argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year,[442] and was named man of the match once again.[443] During a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football.[444] He stated, ""I tried my hardest. The team has ended for me, a decision made.""[445] Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, ""My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States.""[446] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3);[447] he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.[448] Following his announcement, a campaign began in Argentina for Messi to change his mind about retiring.[449] He was greeted by fans with signs like ""Don't go, Leo"" when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, ""We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and we must take care of him.""[450] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement.[451] The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.[452] ""A lot of things went through my mind on the night of the final and I gave serious thought to quitting, but my love for my country and this shirt is too great."" – Messi reversing his decision from retiring on 12 August 2016[453] Just a week after Messi announced his international retirement, Argentine newspaper La Nación reported that he was reconsidering playing for Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September.[454] On 12 August, it was confirmed that Messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 World Cup qualifiers.[455] On 1 September, in his first game back, he scored in a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier.[456] On 28 March 2017, Messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against Chile on 23 March 2017. He was also fined CHF 10,000.[457][458] On 5 May, Messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 CHF fine was lifted by FIFA after Argentina Football Association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play Argentina's remaining World Cup Qualifiers.[459] Argentina's place in the 2018 World Cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. On 10 October, Messi led his country to World Cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as Argentina came from behind to defeat Ecuador 3–1 away; Argentina had not defeated Ecuador in Quito since 2001.[460] Messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside Uruguay's Luis Suárez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot Hernán Crespo.[460] ""The squad is the worst in their history. Even having the best player in the world was not capable of creating a competitive team. All the decline of recent times was hidden by this unrivalled genius [Messi]"" – Former Argentine player Osvaldo Ardiles on the decline in quality of Argentina being masked by Messi.[461] Following on from their poor qualification campaign, expectations were not high going into the 2018 World Cup, with the team, without an injured Messi, losing 6–1 to Spain in March 2018.[462][463] Prior to Argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be Messi's final World Cup.[464] In the team's opening group match against Iceland on 16 June, Messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw.[465] In Argentina's second game on 21 June, the team lost 3–0 to Croatia in a huge upset. Post-match the Argentina coach Jorge Sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding Messi, saying ""we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. We worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. We lost that battle"".[466] Croatia captain and midfielder Luka Modrić also stated post match, ""Messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone.""[467] In Argentina's final group match against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups; he also became the first player to score in the World Cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties.[468] A goal of the tournament contender, Messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot.[469][470] He was awarded Man of the Match.[471] Argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind Croatia.[472] In the round of 16 match against eventual champions France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Agüero's goals in a 3–4 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup.[473] With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four World Cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.[474][475] Following the tournament, Messi stated that he would not participate in Argentina's friendlies against Guatemala and Colombia in September, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. Messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with Argentina prompted speculation in the media that Messi might retire from international football once again.[476] In March 2019, however, he was called up to the Argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against Venezuela and Morocco later that month.[477] A conversation with Lionel Scaloni and his idol Pablo Aimar made Messi reconsider his decision to retire.[478] He made his international return on 22 March, in a 3–1 friendly defeat to Venezuela, in Madrid.[479] On 21 May, Messi was included in Scaloni's final 23-man squad for the 2019 Copa América.[480] In Argentina's second group match on 19 June, Messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1–1 draw against Paraguay.[481] After coming under criticism in the media over his performance following Argentina's 2–0 quarter-final victory over Venezuela on 28 June, Messi commented that it had not been his best Copa América, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches.[482] Following Argentina's 2–0 semi-final defeat to hosts Brazil on 2 July, Messi was critical of the refereeing,[483][484] and alleged the competition was ""set up"" for Brazil to win.[485] In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Messi set-up Agüero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2–1 win, to help Argentina win the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with Gary Medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the Chilean defender.[486] Following the match, Messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off.[487] Messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by CONMEBOL, which ruled him out of Argentina's next World Cup qualifier.[488] On 2 August, Messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by CONMEBOL for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss Argentina's friendly matches against Chile, Mexico and Germany in September and October.[489] On 15 November, Messi played in the 2019 Superclásico de las Américas versus Brazil, scoring the winning goal by a rebound of his saved penalty.[490] On 8 October 2020, Messi scored a penalty in a 1–0 victory against Ecuador, giving Argentina a winning start to their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign.[491] ""It was clear to me that I had to try until the last tournament and that I couldn't withdraw from the national team without winning something."" – Messi on winning the 2021 Copa América in an interview with Diario Sport.[492] On 14 June 2021, Messi scored from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against Chile in Argentina's opening group match of the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[493] On 21 June, Messi played in his 147th match as he equalled Javier Mascherano's record for most appearances for Argentina in a 1–0 win over Paraguay in their third game of the tournament.[494] A week later, he broke the record when he featured in a 4–1 win against Bolivia in his team's final group match, assisting Papu Gómez's opening goal and later scoring two.[495] On 3 July, Messi assisted twice and scored from a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Ecuador in the quarter-finals of the competition.[496] On 6 July, in a 1–1 draw in the semi-finals against Colombia, Messi made his 150th appearance for his country and registered his fifth assist of the tournament, a cut-back for Lautaro Martínez, matching his record of nine goal contributions in a single tournament from five years earlier; he later scored his spot kick in Argentina's eventual 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory to progress to his fifth international final.[497][498] On 10 July, Argentina defeated hosts and defending champions Brazil 1–0 in the final, giving Messi his first major international title and Argentina's first since 1993, as well as his nation's joint record 15th Copa América overall.[499][500] Messi was directly involved in nine out of the 12 goals scored by Argentina, scoring four and assisting five; he was named the player of the tournament for his performances, an honour he shared with Neymar. He also finished as top scorer with four goals tied with Colombia's Luis Díaz, with the Golden Boot awarded to Messi as he had more assists.[501][502] On 9 September, Messi scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win over Bolivia in a 2022 World Cup qualifier which also moved him above Pelé as South America's top male international scorer with 79 goals.[503] In the 2022 Finalissima, the third edition of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, at Wembley on 2 June 2022, Messi assisted twice in a 3–0 victory against Italy and was named player of the match, securing his second trophy for Argentina at the senior level.[504] Messi then followed this on 6 June with all five Argentina goals in a 5–0 victory in a friendly win over Estonia, overtaking Ferenc Puskás among the all-time international men's top scorers.[505] At the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, Messi scored a penalty in Argentina's opening game, a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia, before scoring with a low 20-yard strike in their next match against Mexico in which Argentina won 2–0, also recording an assist on Enzo Fernández's goal.[506] In the last 16 game against Australia, Messi scored the opening goal in Argentina's 2–1 win in what was his 1,000th senior career appearance,[507] and became the most-capped male South American (CONMEBOL member) footballer of all time, surpassing the previous record set by Ecuador's Iván Hurtado, as well as surpassing and equalling several other FIFA World Cup and national team records.[508][509] In the quarter-final against the Netherlands, Messi assisted Argentina's first goal for Nahuel Molina with a reverse pass and then scored a penalty as the game finished 2–2 after extra time. Argentina won 4–3 in the penalty shootout, with Messi scoring the first penalty.[510] In the semi-final against Croatia, Messi made a record-equalling 25th World Cup finals appearance, drawing level with Germany's Lothar Matthäus, and scored the opening goal with a penalty before he assisted Argentina's third goal scored by Julián Álvarez in a 3–0 win;[511] with his 11th World Cup goal, Messi overtook Batistuta to become Argentina's all-time top-scorer at the World Cup.[512] Argentina advanced to the final against France, with Messi stating that it would be his final World Cup appearance.[513][514] In the 2022 FIFA World Cup final on 18 December, Messi made his record 26th World Cup match appearance at Lusail Stadium. He scored Argentina's opening goal with a penalty, becoming in the process the first player since the last-16 round was introduced in 1986 to score a goal in every round of a single World Cup edition.[515][516] After Argentina's eventual two-goal lead was erased by France forward Kylian Mbappé, who scored twice inside two minutes, Messi would score again in extra-time to restore Argentina's lead, before Mbappé again drew France level. Tied 3–3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4–2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[517] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé.[516] With his appearance and two goals in the final, Messi overtook Matthaüs as the player with most appearances at the World Cup (26), and Pelé as the player with most direct goal contributions at the World Cup (21 – 13 goals and 8 assists).[518] The championship game was widely acclaimed as one of the best of all time, with media coverage heavily framing it as a duel between Messi and Mbappé.[519][520][521][522] Following the game, Messi confirmed that he had no plans to retire from the national team, saying ""I want to continue playing as a champion"".[523] In December 2023, a set of jerseys he had worn during the World Cup was sold at auction for 7.8 million dollars.[524] In March 2023, Messi made his return to Argentina as a world champion with two appearances in friendlies in his home country. He scored his 99th international goal with a free-kick in Argentina's 2–0 win over Panama; this also marked his 800th senior career goal for club and country.[525] In the following match against Curaçao, Messi scored a hat-trick, his ninth for Argentina, and recorded an assist in a 7–0 win. The first of his three goals saw him reach 100 international goals, making Messi the third player in history to reach the milestone.[526] Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;[527][528] this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica (""The Atomic Flea"").[529][530][531] Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.[16][528][532] His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed.[533] His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, ""Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.""[46] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[534][535] A prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[536] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[537][538][539] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[528][540] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[541] the most among active players.[542] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[543] Messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch.[532][540][544] Widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world,[545] and one of the greatest dribblers of all time,[546] with regard to this ability, his former Argentina manager Diego Maradona has said of him, ""The ball stays glued to his foot; I've seen great players in my career, but I've never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.""[535] Beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former Barcelona midfielders Xavi and Andrés Iniesta.[527][528] Tactically, Messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward.[405] Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates.[46] Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.[24] Under the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4–3–3 formation,[166][547] while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.[548][549] Under manager Ernesto Valverde, Messi played in a variety of roles. While he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box,[550] or even on the right wing[551] or as a false nine,[552][553] he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4–2–3–1,[549] or as a second striker in a 4–4–2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his team's attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner Suárez.[554][555] As his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, Messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history.[556][557][558] His work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. Indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule.[559] With the Argentina national team, Messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.[410][560] ""I have seen the player who will inherit my place in Argentinian football and his name is Messi."" – Diego Maradona hailing the 18-year-old Messi as his successor in February 2006[69] A prodigious talent as a teenager, Messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20.[62] Diego Maradona considered the 18-year-old Messi the best player in the world alongside Ronaldinho, while the Brazilian himself, shortly after winning the 2005 Ballon d'Or, commented, ""I'm not even the best at Barça"", in reference to his protégé.[561][562] Four years later, after Messi had won his first Ballon d'Or by a record margin,[76] the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history.[12][532][563] An early proponent was his then-manager Pep Guardiola, who, as early as August 2009, declared Messi to be the best player he had ever seen.[564] In the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players,[114][565] and by the end of Barça's second treble-winning season, the view of Messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental Europe.[566][567] He initially received several dismissals by critics, based on the fact that he had not won an international trophy at senior level with Argentina,[568] until he won his first at the 2021 Copa América.[569] Throughout his career, Messi has been compared with his late compatriot Diego Maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. Initially, he was merely one of many young Argentine players, including his boyhood idol Pablo Aimar, to receive the ""New Maradona"" moniker, but as his career progressed, Messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player Argentina had produced since Maradona.[20][403] Jorge Valdano, who won the 1986 World Cup alongside Maradona, said in October 2013, ""Messi is Maradona every day. For the last five years, Messi has been the Maradona of the World Cup in Mexico.""[570] César Menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 World Cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that Messi plays ""at the level of the best Maradona"".[571] Other notable Argentines in the sport, such as Osvaldo Ardiles, Javier Zanetti, and Diego Simeone, have expressed their belief that Messi has overtaken Maradona as the best player in history.[572][573][574] In Argentine society, prior to 2019, Messi was generally held in lesser esteem than Maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. Messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where Maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, Messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football.[376][575][576] An enduring mark against him is the fact that, through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age,[16][376] while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt (until 2019 he did not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays) have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.[409] Football journalist Tim Vickery states the view among Argentines is that Messi ""was always seen as more Catalan than one of them"".[577] Despite having lived in Spain since age 13, Messi rejected the option of representing Spain internationally. He has said: ""Argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. I would change all my records to make the people in my country happy.""[578] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi's leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[579][580][581] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become ""more one of the group, more Argentine"", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[577] Among his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost–Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[582][583] Although Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[584][585] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[152] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d'Or to Ronaldo's five,[586] seven FIFA World's Best Player awards to Ronaldo's five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo's four.[587] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[152][588] Beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiques – Ronaldo is 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in) with a muscular build – and contrasting public personalities with Ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to Messi's humility.[589][590][591] From 2009–10 to 2017–18, Messi faced Ronaldo at least twice every season in El Clásico, which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events.[592] Off the pitch, Ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.[592] After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators, and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.[A] According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the €40 million benchmark, with earnings of €41 million in 2013, and the €50–€60 million points, with income of €65 million in 2014.[157][596] Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[597] In 2018 he was the first player to exceed the €100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of €126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements.[598] Forbes ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019.[599] From 2008, he was Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from €7.8 million to €13 million over the next five years.[81][82][138] Signing a new Barcelona contract in 2017, he earned $667,000 per week in wages, and Barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus.[600] His buyout clause was set at $835 million (€700 million).[600] In 2020, Messi became the second footballer, as well as the second athlete in a team sport, after Cristiano Ronaldo, to surpass $1 billion in earnings during their careers.[601] In addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010.[603] His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barcelona's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court.[604] Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser;[592] from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of Adidas boots, the Adidas Messi.[605][606] Since 2017, he has worn the latest version of the Adidas Nemeziz.[607] In 2015, a Barcelona jersey with Messi's name and number was the best-selling replica jersey worldwide.[608] At the 2022 World Cup, Adidas were sold out of Messi's Argentina No.10 jersey worldwide.[602] As a commercial entity, Messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like Cristiano Ronaldo and David Beckham. At the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as Adidas, Pepsi, and Konami.[610][611] From 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands Dolce & Gabbana and Audemars Piguet.[610][612] Messi is also a global brand ambassador for Gillette, Turkish Airlines, Ooredoo, and Tata Motors, among other companies.[613][614][615][616] Additionally, Messi was the face of Konami's video game series Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of PES 2009, PES 2010, PES 2011 and PES 2020. He subsequently signed with rival company EA Sports to become the face of their series FIFA and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16.[617][618] Messi's global popularity and influence are well documented. He was among the Time 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people as published by Time, in 2011, 2012 and 2023.[619][620][621] His fanbase on the social media website Facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in April 2011, Messi's Facebook page had nearly seven million followers, and by July 2023 he had over 114 million followers, the second highest for a sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[622][623] He also has over 450 million Instagram followers, the second highest for an individual and sportsperson after Cristiano Ronaldo.[624] His World Cup celebration post from 18 December 2022 is the most liked post on Instagram with over 70 million likes.[625] According to a 2014 survey by sports research firm Repucom in 15 international markets, Messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind Ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.[626][627] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a ""tourist attraction"".[628] Other events have illustrated Messi's presence in popular culture. Madame Tussauds unveiled their first wax sculpture of Messi at Wembley Stadium in 2012.[629] A gold replica of his left foot, weighing 25 kg (55 lb) and valued at $5.25 million, went on sale in Japan in March 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.[630] In 2013, a Turkish Airlines advertisement starring Messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant, was the most-watched ad on YouTube in the year of its release, receiving 137 million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005–15 decade to commemorate YouTube's founding.[631][632] World Press Photo selected ""The Final Game"", a photograph of Messi facing the World Cup trophy after Argentina's final defeat to Germany, as the best sports image of 2014.[633] Messi, a documentary about his life by filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia, premiered at the Venice Film Festival in August 2014.[634] In June 2021, Messi signed a five-year deal to become an ambassador for the Hard Rock Cafe brand. He stated, ""sports and music are an integral part of my life. It is an honor to be the first athlete to partner with a brand who has a history of teaming with music legends.""[635] In May 2022, Messi was unveiled as Saudi Arabia's tourism ambassador. Due to Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record, Messi was condemned for taking on the role which was viewed as an attempt of Saudi sportswashing.[636][637] In April 2023, Messi was featured in the 200 year old Thrissur Pooram festival in Kerala, India.[638] During Thrissur Pooram, which is one of the largest festivals in Asia, umbrellas carrying the illuminated cut outs of Messi holding the World Cup trophy were displayed on the top of caparisoned elephants during the Kudamattam ceremony.[639] Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonela Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[640] He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his childhood best friend, Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[641] After keeping their relationship private for a year, Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.[642] ""Leo is not shy. He's introverted. He's reserved."" — Endocrinologist Diego Schwarzstein,[note 5] who addressed Messi's growth hormone deficiency from 1997 to 2001. Messi and Roccuzzo have three sons. To celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, Messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in Argentina's 4–0 win against Ecuador on 2 June 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later.[644] Thiago was born in Barcelona on 2 November 2012.[645] In April 2015, Messi confirmed that they were expecting another child.[646] On 30 June 2017, he married Roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named Hotel City Center in Rosario.[647] In October 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child.[648] Messi and his family are Catholic Christians.[649] Messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, Celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Matías, manage his charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.[650] Since leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of ""The Machine of '87"" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.[16][651][652] Messi has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's.[653] Messi holds triple citizenship, as he is a citizen of Argentina, Italy, and Spain.[654] Throughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association.[655][656] Messi has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children.[657] To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.[658] In addition to his work with UNICEF, Messi founded his own charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children.[659] It was established in 2007 following a visit Messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in Boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society.[651] Through his foundation, Messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere in the world.[651][660] In addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global ""Messi and Friends"" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with Adidas as their main sponsor.[661][662] Messi has also invested in youth football in Argentina: he financially supports Sarmiento, a football club based in the Rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at Newell's Old Boys and rival club Rosario Central, as well as at River Plate and Boca Juniors in Buenos Aires.[651] At Newell's Old Boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. His former youth coach at Newell's, Ernesto Vecchio, is employed by the Leo Messi Foundation as a talent scout for young players.[16] On 7 June 2016, Messi won a libel case against La Razón newspaper and was awarded €65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières.[663] Messi made a donation worth €1 million ($1.1 million) to fight the spread of coronavirus.[664] This was split between Clinic Barcelona hospital in Barcelona, Spain and his native Argentina.[665] In addition to this, Messi along with his fellow FC Barcelona teammates announced he will be taking a 70% cut in salaries during the 2020 coronavirus emergency, and contribute further to the club to provide fully to salaries of all the clubs employees.[666] In November 2016, with the Argentine Football Association being run by a FIFA committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told Messi that they had not received their salaries for six months. He stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.[667][668] In February 2021, Messi donated to the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya his Adidas shoes which he wore when he scored his 644th goal for Barcelona and broke Pelé's record for most goals scored for a single club; the shoes were later auctioned off in April by the museum for charity to help children with cancer and were sold for £125,000.[669] In advance of the 2021 Copa América in Uruguay, Messi donated three signed shirts to the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech—whose directors spoke of their admiration for Messi—in order to secure 50,000 doses of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, in the hope of vaccinating all of South America's football players.[670] A deal brokered by Uruguay's president Luis Lacalle Pou, the plan to prioritise football players caused some controversy given widespread vaccine scarcity in the region, with the Mayor of Canelones Yamandú Orsi remarking that ""Just as the president manifested cooperation with CONMEBOL to vaccinate for the Copa América, he could just as well have the same consideration for Canelones"".[670] Messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[671] Facing the judge, he said, ""I just played football. I signed the contracts because I trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.""[672] Barcelona[687] Paris Saint-Germain[688] Inter Miami Argentina U20

"74484",":Article","  Lee James Stephen Hodson (born 2 October 1991)[4] is a professional footballer who plays for National League club Eastleigh. Hodson is a defender, and plays primarily as a right-back, but has had spells at left back and as a wingback during his career.[5] He made his first team debut for Watford in May 2009 against Derby County, before playing in the majority of Watford's games in the 2009–10 season, during which he earned a three-year professional contract. Hodson was born in England and was eligible to play for Northern Ireland through his grandmother. He has represented the latter country at youth, under-19 and under-21 levels, and in November 2010 was called up to the senior Northern Ireland team for the first time. Hodson was born in Hertfordshire, and grew up in Borehamwood, near Watford. He was involved with ""Borehamwood 2000"", a football scheme run by Boreham Wood, before joining Watford's youth system.[6] Hodson progressed through the academy, playing 26 times for the under-18 side in 2007–08 despite still being a schoolboy.[7] He also started nine times for the club's reserve team.[8] Hodson signed for the club as an academy scholar in June 2008, and continued to play for the club's reserve and under-18 teams in the 2008–09 season.[9] Hodson was named on Watford's substitute bench for the first time on 3 May 2009, in a home game against Derby County. He was brought in the 65th minute, as a substitute for Arsenal loanee Gavin Hoyte. The match finished as a 3–1 Watford win.[10] Following two separate injuries to club captain Jay DeMerit early in the 2009–10 season, Adrian Mariappa moved to central defence, and Hodson started to play regularly in the Championship at right back.[11] Hodson played in every Watford first team game in September and October 2009, and by November he had earned himself a three-year professional contract with the club.[12] He went on to play 34 first-team matches that season—31 in the Championship—and picked up 2 yellow cards.[13] Although primarily used at right-back, he deputised at left-back when Lloyd Doyley sustained an injury towards the end of the season.[14] Hodson was named the Championship's Apprentice of the Month for November 2009, and was nominated for the division's Apprentice of the Year award; the other nominees were Adam Matthews and Nathan Modest.[15] Matthews, an under-21 international for Wales, eventually won the award.[16] At the start of the 2010–11 season, Hodson retained his place in the first team, playing in all of Watford's first eight league fixtures.[13] However, following the arrival of left-back Andrew Taylor on loan from Middlesbrough, Hodson faced competition from Doyley for his place at right-back.[17] After period out of the team, Hodson returned to Watford's starting line-up early in 2011, following Taylor's return to Middlesbrough.[18] He scored his first ever senior goal against Leeds United in the Championship on 16 April 2011.[19] Following the arrival of left back Carl Dickinson, Hodson faced competition at right back from Doyley in the 2011–12 season. Hodson did not make his first start until 29 October.[20] He featured regularly in subsequent months; by 3 March 2012 Hodson had made 20 league starts, although that date marked his last appearance in the 2011–12 season.[13] On 22 November 2012, Hodson joined Brentford on loan until early January.[21] Hodson extended his loan with Brentford on 8 January 2013 until the end of the 2012–13 season.[22] On 20 July 2013, Hodson joined Milton Keynes Dons on a one-year contract, with the option of another year.[23] On 29 May 2015, Hodson signed a new two-year contract.[24] On 1 February 2016, Hodson signed for Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock on loan until the end of the 2015–16 season.[25] On 29 June 2016, Hodson joined Scottish Premiership side Rangers on a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.[26] He made his debut for the club in a League Cup match against Annan Athletic on 19 July 2016.[27] On 3 December 2016, he scored his first goal for the club, against Aberdeen, in a 2–1 victory at Ibrox Stadium.[28] On 20 August 2018, Hodson joined Scottish Premiership side St Mirren on loan on a season-long loan deal.[29] On 8 June 2019, Hodson joined League One side Gillingham on a two-year contract.[30] After limited appearances for Gillingham, Hodson rejoined St Mirren on loan in January 2020, until the end of the season.[31] He signed on loan for Hamilton Academical on 10 August 2020.[32] He scored his first goal for Hamilton in a 3–0 win over Motherwell on 2 January 2021.[33] On 3 September 2021, Hodson signed a one-year deal with Kilmarnock, who had been relegated into the Scottish Championship at the end of 2020–21 season.[34] In August 2022, he joined Partick Thistle on loan until January 2023.[35] Hodson scored his first goal for Thistle in a 4–2 away defeat to Ayr United.[36] In January 2023, Hodson's loan at Thistle was extended until the end of the 2022–23 season.[37] Hodson departed Kilmarnock at the end of the 2022–23 season.[38] On 30 June 2023, Hodson signed for National League club Eastleigh.[39] Hodson, who was born and raised in England, is eligible to play for Northern Ireland as his paternal grandmother was born in the country's capital, Belfast.[6][40] Having represented Northern Ireland at youth and under-19 levels, Hodson moved up to the under-21 team aged 17 in 2009. He played his first games at that level in a side captained by Hodson's former Watford teammate Craig Cathcart.[41][42] In March 2010 Northern Ireland under-21 manager Steve Beaglehole claimed that the English FA had approached Hodson with a view to him switching his allegiance to England.[40] Hodson remained with Northern Ireland, and made his debut call up to the senior squad in November 2010, for a friendly against Morocco. He was subsequently selected for the match.[43][44] Later that season, Hodson played all of Northern Ireland's matches in the Nations Cup.[13][45] In 2011–12, Hodson played his first games in the UEFA European Football Championships, in Northern Ireland's qualifiers against Estonia and Italy.[13] He was named in the Northern Ireland squad for the EURO 2016 when his squad made it out of the group stage, Northern Ireland's best performance in the UEFA European Championship.[46] Hodson however, did not make a tournament appearance.

"74485",":Article","  Johan Etienne Anthony Cavalli (born 12 September 1981) is a French former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Whilst at Lorient Cavalli played as a substitute in the 2002 Coupe de France Final in which they beat SC Bastia.[3] Cavalli joined Watford on deadline day of the 2007 January transfer window, on a free transfer from French side Istres, signing an 18-month contract.[4] He made his debut in the 1–0 win against West Ham United on 10 February 2007.[5] He had his contract with ""Hornets"" cancelled by mutual consent on 20 August 2007.[6] On 18 October 2007, it was announced that Cavalli had signed a two-year contract with Belgian club Mons.[7] In May 2008, he left the club my mutual consent.[8] Cavalli joined his hometown club AC Ajaccio in November 2010 on a contract running until 2013.[9] He started on the opening day of the 2011–12 Ligue 1 season, playing 77 minutes in a 2–0 loss to Toulouse.[10] He was also in the starting eleven for Ajaccio's trip to the Stade Gerland the following weekend and played 78 minutes in a 1–1 draw with hosts Lyon.[11] In Ajaccio 1–1 draw against fellow Ligue 1 newcomers Evian on 20 August 2011 he set up midfield partner Frédéric Sammaritano for the 7th-minute 1–0 lead following a ""great combination"" between him and Benjamin André.[12] Following a five-match suspension, Cavalli returned on 10 April 2015 to face Dijon. He scored via penalty as Ajaccio beat Dijon 1–0 at the Stade François Coty.[13] At the end of the 2019–20 season, after ten years with Ajaccio, Cavalli retired from playing.[14][15] Cavalli was capped for the Corsica national football team, which is not a FIFA member, as it does not represent a fully sovereign nation. On 31 May 2011, he scored the only goal to help his team to a prestigious 1–0 win over Bulgaria in a friendly match.[16] Cavalli's father Jean-Michel is also a former footballer and coached him during his time at Créteil.[17]","Johan Cavalli","[""Johan Etienne Anthony Cavalli"",""midfielder"",""AC Ajaccio"",""football team"",""French"",""substitute"",""Lorient Cavalli"",""Jean-Michel"",""Coupe de France Final"",""SC Bastia."",""Frédéric Sammaritano"",""contract"",""Watford"",""win"",""transfer"",""debut"",""transfer window"",""side"",""contract"",""contract"",""club"",""club"",""season"",""consent"",""draw"",""draw"",""hometown club"",""loss"",""trip"",""hosts"",""newcomers"",""member"",""Istres"",""Hornets"",""West Ham United"",""consent."",""season"",""Ligue 1"",""Toulouse."",""Belgian"",""Mons."",""nation"",""team"",""win"",""Evian"",""Lyon."",""Stade Gerland"",""goal"",""combination"",""Corsica"",""FIFA"",""lead"",""suspension"",""penalty"",""Bulgaria"",""Créteil."",""Dijon"",""Benjamin André."",""Stade François Coty."",""Dijon"",""2013"",""1"",""2007 January"",""10 February 2007"",""20 August 2007"",""18 October 2007"",""May 2008"",""November 2010"",""12 September 1981"",""2011"",""20 August 2011"",""10 April 2015"",""2019"",""31 May 2011"",""eleven"",""5"",""8"",""2019"",""five"",""1"",""18"",""14"",""10"",""2002"",""10"",""2007"",""0"",""7"",""two"",""0"",""20"",""1"",""2011"",""0"",""9"",""0"",""11"",""77"",""2"",""1"",""10"",""17"",""2015"",""3"",""1"",""13"",""2007"",""2011"",""15"",""18"",""2011"",""2008"",""20"",""2013"",""12"",""31"",""2007"",""4"",""16"",""6"",""ten"",""12"",""78"",""2007"",""7"",""2010"",""0"",""1"",""1"",""12"",""1"",""1981"",""1"",""1"",""20"",""2002""]","0.0023686400570000683","true","[0.78524005,0.021143993,0.019943215,0.018518489,0.016423237,0.0089953225,0.008897836,0.008697913,0.005330361,0.005330361,0.0048038466,0.004576037,0.004489257,0.0038877137,0.0038877137,0.0034156481,0.0034156481,0.0034156481,0.003127438,0.0030892512,0.002876702,0.002876702,0.002656515,0.0026240654,0.0024375075,0.0024375075,0.0024219684,0.0023336487,0.00214121,0.00214121,0.00214121,0.00204615,0.0020200585,0.0020200585,0.0020200585,0.0019061184,0.0018214791,0.001688764,0.0013796275,0.0013627571,0.0013627571,0.0013468158,0.0012714347,0.0012714347,0.0012657746,0.0012657746,0.0012657746,0.0011167468,0.0011100442,9.456372E-4,9.456372E-4,7.074907E-4,7.0396805E-4,7.014793E-4,6.5992743E-4,6.5992743E-4,4.7359502E-4,4.1594097E-4,4.1447015E-4,3.1433144E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Johan Cavalli - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Cavalli",,,,,,,
"74486",":Article","  John Mark Eustace (born 3 November 1979) is an English professional football coach and former player who was most recently head coach of EFL Championship club Birmingham City. During his playing career, he played as a central midfielder for Coventry City, Stoke City, Watford and Derby County. He also spent time on loan at Dundee United, Middlesbrough and Hereford United. After retiring as a player, Eustace served as manager of Kidderminster Harriers between 2016 and 2018, eventually leaving to become assistant manager of Queens Park Rangers in 2018. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager at QPR in 2019. Born in Solihull, Eustace began his career as a trainee at Coventry City. Despite the fact that he was at the club for seven years, he only recorded 98 appearances in all competitions due to injuries. At 19 he went out on loan to Dundee United to gain first team experience. He played eleven matches and scored one goal against Hearts,[2] becoming a firm favourite with United fans who voted him their young player of the year. He returned to Coventry where he began to establish himself in the first team. In the 2000–01 season, he appeared in 32 league games. Despite his efforts, the club were relegated from the Premier League. At the start of the next season, he was named as captain by manager Gordon Strachan.[3] However, on 8 September 2001, Eustace was struck down with a knee injury during Coventry's league defeat to Grimsby which kept him sidelined for 7 months. He returned to action in April 2002.[4] Eustace started the 2002–03 season well and attracted interest from Premier League club Middlesbrough, to whom he was loaned out for one month in January 2003.[5] He only made one substitute appearance, away to Liverpool, where he appeared for only the final two minutes of the game, but earned himself a yellow card.[6] Eustace made 33 league appearances over the season, his last with Coventry. At the start of the 2003–04 season, Eustace left Coventry for fellow second-tier team Stoke City on a free transfer.[7] He made his debut in a 3–0 win over Derby County at the start of the 2003–04 season and helped the side to 11th place in the Championship, scoring five goals. Injury problems restricted him to a handful of appearances over the next two seasons – in the Potters' 1–0 win over Wigan Athletic in February 2005,[8] Eustace suffered a knee injury and was then substituted, in only his 8th appearance of the season. It later became clear that his injury would keep him out for at least the rest of the season.[9] He missed the rest of the 2004–05 season and all of the 2005–06 season because of the injury. However, Eustace signed a one-year contract extension at the beginning of the season, which lasted until the end of the 2006–07 season. Eustace returned from his long injury lay off in June 2006.[10] He made his first appearance for Stoke City in over 18 months in their 2–0 friendly win over local opposition Newcastle Town. On 13 October 2006, Eustace joined Hereford United on loan to gain first team football to aid his comeback.[11] During his time at Edgar Street he was a key part of the Hereford midfield, and his loan was extended to the New Year.[12] However, on 14 December 2006 he was suddenly recalled by Stoke due to them suffering several injuries in midfield.[13] John's grandfather Ken Eustace also played one match for Hereford during the 1949–50 season. Eustace returned to the Stoke starting line up in the 3rd round FA Cup match against Millwall. On 11 February 2007, he started his first league match of the season in Stoke's 1–0 loss to Birmingham City. In total, Eustace made 23 league appearances over the course of the season for Stoke and Hereford. Eustace later signed a one-year contract extension with the club, to take him up until the summer of 2008.[14] He was a regular for Stoke during the first half of the 2007–08 season and captained the team up until his move to Watford on the last day of the transfer window. On 31 January 2008, Eustace joined Watford from Stoke City for a fee of £250,000.[15] On 20 September 2008, Eustace ""scored"" a bizarre opening own goal in the game between Watford and Reading, where a goalmouth scramble saw the ball go nowhere near the goal line, despite the linesman flagging for a goal to the bemusement of everyone in the ground. A corner from Stephen Hunt bounced off of Eustace and was hooked back by Noel Hunt. What could have been a debatable corner for Reading, initially given as a goal kick, was actually then given as a goal. The game ended Watford 2–2 Reading.[16] On 9 March 2009, he joined Championship rivals Derby County on loan until the end of the 2008/09 season, in order to help solve the Rams' midfield injury crisis.[17] He made his Derby debut in the 1–1 draw away to Southampton, and scored against his parent club on the final day of the season.[18] However, Eustace failed to secure a permanent move to Derby at the end of his loan spell with the club and returned to Watford at the beginning of May.[19] However, Derby manager Nigel Clough said ""He's got a year left at Watford. If he's still in the same situation at the start of next season, needing a loan, then we might look at that.""[20] With his Hornets career seemingly in jeopardy, Eustace signed an amended contract stipulating that he would not receive his sizeable appearance fee, freeing up Malky Mackay to pick the tenacious midfielder. After being handed the number 28 jersey for the season, Eustace went on to play an instrumental role as Watford retained their Championship status for another season. Eustace was also handed the captaincy on a number of occasions with first-choice skipper Jay DeMerit sidelined through injury. Eustace made over forty appearances in league and cup competitions and was the 'Player's Player of the Season' as voted by his peers.[21] After much speculation throughout the 2009–10 off-season, Eustace finally put pen-to-paper on a new two-year contract with Watford. Eustace and Mackay later revealed that he had passed a medical at Leeds United, and that there was interest from other clubs.[22] Ahead of the season, Mackay handed Eustace the captaincy, after DeMerit was released on a Bosman transfer.[23] He started the season in good form, scoring Watford's first goal of the season in a 3–2 win at Norwich City,[24] followed a week later with an over-head finish in a 2–2 draw against former club Coventry which turned out to be 2010/11 goal of the season.[25] Eustace kept the captain's armband following the managerial appointment of Sean Dyche in June 2011 and signed a new two-year contract until 2013 at the end of July despite interest from Derby County.[26] In June 2013, Eustace was offered a new contract with a player/coach role, which he declined, stating that he was not ready to turn away from playing just yet, therefore leaving the club as a free agent.[27] In July 2013, it was confirmed by Derby County that Eustace had rejoined the club on trial, with a view to earning a contract[28] and after impressing Nigel Clough in pre-season training and friendly games, Eustace verbally agreed a one-year contract with Derby[29] and the move was made official on 24 July.[30] Eustace was originally expected to play a bit part role and according to Clough Eustace was to act as cover in his natural central midfield position as well as being an emergency central defender.[31] Eustace came on as a late substitute for Will Hughes in Derby's opening game against Blackburn Rovers. His first Derby start was in the 1–0 League Cup win at Oldham Athletic.[32] Eustace scored the first goal of his second spell at Derby with a looping header against Queens Park Rangers on 10 February 2014, at Pride Park. He picked up a serious knee cartilage injury against Ipswich Town in a 1–0 victory on 10 January 2015, a focal point in defensive central midfield, Eustace had only been on the losing side once in 14 appearances prior to his injury for Derby during the 2014–15 season. His manager Steve McClaren described Eustace's injury as a 'big blow'.[33] The injury required an operation and ruled him out for the remainder of the season.[34] Eustace was released by Derby in June 2015.[35] On 22 June 2015, Eustace was linked with a move to Scottish giants Rangers, with newly appointed manager Mark Warburton claiming, ""People like John Eustace are few and far between, people like John are ultra-professional on and off the pitch. They are great role models. If you look at his record and the win ratio when John's playing, it's really important. He had a big role to play at Derby over the last few years.""[36] Despite the link to Rangers, Eustace retired from playing due to his injury.[37] Following his retirement as a player, Eustace moved into coaching. On 21 April 2016, he was named manager of National League side Kidderminster Harriers, signing a one-year contract until the end of the 2016–17 season.[38] While at the club, Eustace transformed the side's style of play,[39] with the Harriers being dubbed the ""non-league Barcelona"".[40] Eustace led his side to the play-offs in two seasons, as well as the First Round Proper of the FA Cup.[39] He left the club on 25 May 2018 to join former manager Steve McClaren at Queens Park Rangers as assistant manager.[41] At QPR, he had a brief spell as caretaker manager in 2019,[42] helping the club avoid relegation from the Championship with 7 points from his 7 games in charge.[37] Following Mark Warburton's arrival as manager in May 2019, Eustace remained as his assistant and began studying for his UEFA Pro Licence.[37][43] In March 2022 he was named as Assistant Manager of the Republic of Ireland team under manager Stephen Kenny, while he would also continue his existing role at QPR.[44] Eustace, along with Matt Gardiner, left his role at QPR in June 2022 following the appointment of new manager Michael Beale.[45] Eustace succeeded Lee Bowyer as head coach of Championship club Birmingham City on 3 July 2022. His first managerial role in the football league, he signed a three-year contract.[46] Eustace's first competitive game in charge was a 0–0 draw away to Luton Town. Eustace would gain his first victory as Birmingham manager in the following match day, beating Huddersfield Town at home on 5 August 2022. Despite his side being the bookies' odds-on favourite to finish 24th in the 2022-23 EFL Championship, Eustace was able to guide the club to its highest points tally since 2016, successfully avoiding relegation amid a backdrop of off-field struggles.[47] On 9 October 2023, Eustace was sacked with the club citing the importance of the board of directors and management being fully aligned on the culture of the football club as the reason behind the decision, despite an impressive start to the season had seen the club sitting in sixth position with eighteen points from eleven matches.[48] Following Eustace's dismissal, the club fell to 20th on just 28 points by the end of 2023 under the replacement manager, Wayne Rooney.

"74487",":Article","  Troy Matthew Deeney (born 29 June 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker. He was most recently manager of EFL League Two club Forest Green Rovers. Deeney started his professional career at Walsall. He spent a brief spell on loan with Southern League Premier Division club Halesowen Town during the 2006–07 season. He transferred to Championship club Watford in 2010 and captained the team to promotion to the Premier League in the 2014–15 season. After 11 years and more than 400 matches with Watford, he left the club as a free agent in August 2021 and spent two years with Birmingham City. He joined Forest Green Rovers in August 2023 in a player/coach role and became permanent manager later that year, but was sacked in January 2024. Troy Matthew Deeney[2] was born on 29 June 1988 in Birmingham, West Midlands,[3] one of three children born to his parents, and grew up in Chelmsley Wood. At the age of 10, Deeney and his mother were assaulted by his father, leading to visits from social services. The couple split when Deeney was 11 with his mother taking custody of their children. He maintained a relationship with his father, who was a drug dealer in Deeney's local area.[4] Deeney was expelled from school when he was 14, before returning at the age of 15 but left at 16 without any GCSEs. Since 2012 he has earned GCSEs in English, Science and Maths.[5] Deeney was invited by the Aston Villa academy to take part in a four-day summer trial at the age of 15 with a view to earning a youth contract; however, he missed the first three days as he ""knew there was a game on the last day"" and was not offered terms by Villa.[6] After leaving school in 2004 he had begun training as a bricklayer, earning £120 a week, and joined Chelmsley Town. He made his debut on 9 October 2004 in a 2–1 victory against Mile Oak Rovers,[7] only coming into the first team as several players were unavailable because the game was an early kick-off – it had been brought forward to avoid clashing with England's 2006 World Cup Qualifier against Wales.[8] After holding down a regular place in the team, Deeney went on to win Chelmsley Town's Player of the Year for the 2005–06 season.[9] Deeney was spotted by Walsall's Head of Youth Mick Halsall, who only attended the match because his son was also playing, and because the match he was scheduled to attend had been postponed. Deeney was playing while drunk, but scored seven goals in an 11–4 win. He was offered a trial by the then League Two club, but only attended after his Chelmsley manager got him out of bed and paid for his taxi.[5] After signing for Walsall on 18 December 2006, Deeney was instantly sent out to Halesowen Town on loan for the rest of the 2006–07 season.[10] He scored his first professional competitive goal for Walsall against Millwall in a 2–1 win in September 2007.[11] This turned out to be his only goal of the 2007–08 season, and the 2008–09 season started similarly, with him managing only two goals in the first half of the season. However, the introduction of Chris Hutchings as manager coincided with Deeney finding a goalscoring touch. Helped by the fact that his new manager started playing him in his favoured striking position, instead of on the right wing as the previous manager Jimmy Mullen had, Deeney scored nine goals in Hutchings' first 12 matches in charge.[10][12] On 9 September 2009, it was announced that Deeney had signed a new two-year deal until 2011.[13] In the 2009–10 season, Deeney scored 14 goals to finish as Walsall's top scorer and was awarded the club's Player of the Year award.[14] On 4 August 2010, Deeney handed in a written transfer request amid interest from several Championship clubs. He had been told he was to leave Walsall earlier in the summer, and had slackened his pre-season training in protest at the club's hardline stance when trying to sell him.[5] He signed for Watford two days later for an initial fee of £250,000 rising up to £500,000 on a two-year contract that lifted his salary from £1,200 to £6,000 a week.[5] Walsall also negotiated a 20% sell-on fee for any profit were Watford to sell him in the future, something that later would complicate potential transfers away from the club according to Deeney in 2018.[15] On the same day Deeney signed for Watford, he played a part in their 3–2 win against Norwich City on the opening day of the season, coming on for Marvin Sordell in the second half.[16] Deeney found his poor pre-season meant he struggled for fitness in comparison to his new teammates.[5] He scored his first Watford goal against Notts County in the first round of the League Cup on 24 August.[17] Deeney went on to make 40 appearances for Watford in his first season, scoring three goals from 20 starts, although he was mainly deployed on the wing by Malky Mackay.[18] At the beginning of the 2011–12 campaign, Deeney initially found it hard to acquire a starting spot in the team as many of his early season matches saw him consigned to a bench role.[5] He soon found his way into the starting eleven and amassed a total of 46 appearances under the management of Sean Dyche in his preferred position as striker.[19][20] In March, Deeney signed a new contract to the end of the 2012–13 season.[21] He finished 2011–12 as Watford's top goalscorer with 12 goals in all competitions and also won the Goal of the Season Award for his goal against Ipswich Town in March 2012.[22] Deeney made his first appearance for Watford, after his release from prison, against Bristol City at Vicarage Road on 22 September 2012. The match finished 2–2, with Deeney coming on in the second half and hitting the post.[23] He started the next match against Huddersfield Town on 29 September, and scored the winner from a spot kick in the 3–2 away win.[24] He scored a memorable double against his boyhood club, Birmingham City, as Watford ran out 4–0 winners on 16 February 2013.[25] In March 2013, Deeney signed a new contract with Watford, keeping him at the club until 2016.[26] Deeney netted another brace in a 4–0 win over Blackburn Rovers on 20 April 2013, taking his tally to 18 for the season.[27] Six days later, he scored his 19th goal of the season in the next match against Leicester, scoring the first goal in an important 2–1 away win for Watford.[28] On 12 May 2013, Watford faced Leicester City in the play-off semi-final second leg at Vicarage Road. In one of the most dramatic ends to a play-off match in history, Deeney scored a goal deep into injury time to qualify for the Championship Play-off final at Wembley. After Manuel Almunia saved a penalty taken by Anthony Knockaert and a rebound, Watford charged down to the other end, and Deeney lashed in the winning goal in the seventh minute of added time – an ecstatic Deeney celebrated the goal by jumping into the crowd.[29] After scoring 20 goals in the 2012–13 season, Deeney scored the only goal as Watford beat Birmingham City 1–0 in the opening match of the 2013–14 season.[30] A week later on 10 August, Deeney scored a hat-trick as Watford thrashed Bournemouth 6–1 at Vicarage Road. In doing so, he became the first Watford player to score a hat-trick in a match since Michael Chopra in 2003, and the first one to do so at Vicarage Road since David Connolly on 7 December 1996. It was also Deeney's first career hat-trick.[31] Netting a brace in a 4–1 win away against Sheffield Wednesday on 29 March 2014, Deeney took his 2013–14 season tally to 20 goals. In the process, he became the first Watford player to score 20 or more goals in consecutive seasons in all competitions since Luther Blissett managed the feat in 1983.[32] Deeney scored again, this time against Burnley in a 1–1 draw on 5 April 2014, to become the first Watford player to score 20 league goals in consecutive seasons since Cliff Holton managed the feat in 1961.[33] The striker won both the Watford Player of the Season award for 2013–14 and also won the Players' Player of the Year at the end of season awards on 2 May 2014.[34] Following the departure of Manuel Almunia, Deeney was named the Watford captain by manager Giuseppe Sannino prior to the 2014–15 campaign.[35] During the course of the 2014–15 Championship season, Deeney helped Watford earn promotion to the Premier League.[36] In the process he became the first player in Watford history to score 20 or more goals in three consecutive seasons (2012–13, 2013–14, 2014–15).[37] On 8 August 2015, Deeney made his Premier League debut, captaining Watford in their 2015–16 season opener, a 2–2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park.[38] On 24 October, he scored his first Premier League goal as Watford defeated Stoke City 2–0 at the Britannia Stadium.[39] On 21 November, Deeney scored a penalty against Manchester United in the 87th minute to equalise; just after that, he scored an own goal in the 90th minute to help Manchester United secure a 2–1 victory over Watford in a dramatic change of events at Vicarage Road.[40] Deeney would extend his goal streak to five in six matches with the opener in a 2–0 win against Norwich City on 5 December 2015.[41] On 13 February 2016, he scored twice in a 2–1 away win over Crystal Palace and in the process extended the Eagles' winless run in the league to nine matches.[42] On 1 July 2016, Deeney signed a new five-year deal with Watford.[43] He opened his 2016–17 goalscoring account on 10 September at West Ham United's new home venue, the London Stadium, equalising in a 4–2 comeback victory.[44] Deeney scored his 100th Watford goal in all competitions on 26 December 2016 with a penalty in a 1–1 home draw against Crystal Palace, ending a ten-match goalless run. He became the fifth player to reach a century of goals for Watford.[45] Since summer 2018 he has given up gambling entirely and alcohol in weeks Watford are playing.[46] In April 2019 Deeney (and Watford team-mates Adrian Mariappa and Christian Kabasele) were subjected to racist comments on social media.[47] In May 2020, following the Premier League's suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Deeney initially refused to return to non-contact training with his teammates. He said he did not wish to put his five-month-old child at risk, who has breathing difficulties, saying ""it only takes one person to get infected within the group and I don't want to be bringing that home.""[48] Deeney eventually returned to training and captained Watford in their first game back against Leicester City, playing the full 90 minutes. On 11 July, he scored two second-half penalties to come from behind and win at home against Newcastle United, giving Deeney his first goals of the restarted season.[49] Deeney revealed after the game he had been suffering from a right knee injury since the restart, but vowed to see out the end of the season as club captain and try to save Watford from relegation.[50] Following this announcement, Deeney was often substituted in the second half of most games for the remainder of the season to ease the workload on his knee. He scored again in a 3–1 loss against West Ham United on 17 July, later coming off in the second half.[51] In Watford's final game of the season against Arsenal, Deeney played the full 90 minutes and scored a penalty in the first half, but was unable to prevent Watford losing 3–2, finishing in 19th and suffering relegation to the EFL Championship.[52] After this loss, it was highly speculated that Deeney had played his last game for the club; Deeney commented, saying he was ""unsure"" about his future at Watford.[53] Despite widespread rumours of his impending departure[54] and reported interest from Tottenham Hotspur,[55] West Bromwich Albion[56] and Fenerbahçe,[57] Deeney remained with Watford throughout the summer transfer window and came off the bench during their 1–0 win over Luton Town on 26 September 2020.[58] Watford secured immediate promotion back to the Premier League on 24 April 2021, after a 1–0 home victory over Millwall.[59] Deeney came on as a 79th-minute substitute for Tom Cleverley in Watford's first match since their return to the top flight on 14 August 2021, helping secure a win after beating Aston Villa 3–2 at home [60] Deeney made his final appearance for Watford as a 78th-minute substitute, replacing Ken Sema in a 2–0 away loss to Brighton & Hove Albion on 21 August.[61] On 30 August 2021, Deeney left Watford as a free agent after eleven years with the club; he had made 419 appearances for the team and scored 140 goals.[62][63] He left the club as their all-time top scorer in the Premier League with 47 goals and ranks fourth for most goals scored for Watford in all competitions, behind Luther Blissett (186), Tommy Barnett (163) and Ross Jenkins (142).[64] On 30 August 2021, Deeney signed a two-year contract with Birmingham City, the team he had supported since childhood.[63][65] He made his debut, as a 67th-minute substitute for Lukas Jutkiewicz in a 2–0 home victory over Derby County on 10 September,[66] and five days later scored his first Birmingham goal, a late penalty in a 4–1 loss at home to Fulham.[67] Over the two years he spent with Birmingham, he scored 11 goals from 56 appearances in all competitions,[68] and was appointed club captain in January 2022.[69] He was one of six senior professionals released at the end of the 2022–23 season.[70] Deeney joined League Two club Forest Green Rovers on 17 August 2023 as a player-coach.[71] On his debut two days later, he came on as a substitute in a 3–0 home loss to Newport County,[72] and on 26 August he came from the bench and scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at AFC Wimbledon.[73] Deeney scored a hat-trick on 23 September, though his team lost 4–3 away to Notts County.[74] After manager David Horseman left the club by mutual consent, Deeney was appointed head coach on a permanent basis on 20 December 2023, at which time the team were 23rd in League Two, five points from safety.[75] Two days later on his debut, the team drew 0–0 away to Gillingham.[76] Following a 2–0 loss to Harrogate Town in January 2024, Deeney publicly criticised his squad, stating that he said that he would ""rather watch Antiques Roadshow"" than his team, in addition to singling out right-back Fankaty Dabo as ""awful."" Former professionals Chris Sutton, Shay Given, and Martin O'Neill criticised his public comments.[77] Deeney stood by his comments but later expressed regret at telling the media, stating ""I don't apologise for what I said, I just apologised as it was said in public.""[78] On 18 January 2024, Deeney was sacked as manager.[79] In October 2015, Deeney revealed that he had twice rejected invitations to play for Jamaica internationally and that he harboured an ambition of playing for England.[80] Deeney originally believed he was eligible to play for Northern Ireland but that possibility was quickly ruled out as neither his parents nor grandparents are from Northern Ireland.[81] Having never been selected for England at a youth level, Deeney remained uncapped. Deeney is divorced from his wife Stacy, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He has been in a relationship with model Alisha Hosannah since July 2018.[4] He is a lifelong supporter of Birmingham City and has the club crest tattooed on his calf.[82] His brother, Ellis, is a semi-professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder. Ellis started his career at Aston Villa, where he was captain of their academy team before being released.[5] On 25 June 2012, Deeney was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment after pleading guilty to a charge of affray, having attacked a group of students outside a nightclub. The Guardian reported that a ""30-second video clip, which was played to the court several times, clearly showed both Troy Deeney and Brennan [Deeney's friend] kicking out at the ""defenceless"" students, one of whom received repeated blows to the head as he lay injured.""[83][84][85][86] He was released after serving almost three months of the sentence. Deeney has cited his grief surrounding his father's death from cancer in May 2012 as a reason for the behaviour leading to his arrest.[4][5] In March 2020, Deeney was hospitalised with COVID-19 and spent five days in hospital with a high temperature and kidney and intestine issues.[87] He was on a ventilator for four days and admitted that he ""struggled for breath"" in Watford's last match before lockdown.[88] In October 2020, Deeney began working as a guest writer for The Sun, penning a fortnightly column for the paper's sports section. He is also a weekly guest on TalkSport's Monday morning breakfast show, appearing alongside Laura Woods and Ally McCoist.[89] In April 2021, he launched a podcast, Deeney Talks.[90] Deeney took part on Celebrity Mastermind in 2023. He answered no questions correctly on his specialist subject, the Spider-Man films of Sam Raimi, but came third of four contestants.[91] Watford Individual","Troy Deeney","[""Troy Matthew

"74488",":Article","  Mark Stephen Anthony Yeates (born 11 January 1985) is an Irish professional football coach and former player who played as a winger. Yeates began his career with Tottenham Hotspur but failed to make the transition to the first team, spending time on loan at Brighton & Hove Albion, Swindon Town, Colchester United, Hull City and Leicester City. On leaving Spurs he returned on a permanent deal to Colchester before spells with Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Watford, Bradford City, Oldham Athletic, Blackpool and Notts County. He has three under-21 caps for the Republic of Ireland. Yeates played schoolboy football with Greenhills Boys and Cherry Orchard in Dublin.[2] He started his senior career at Tottenham Hotspur, but first played professional football in loan spells with Brighton & Hove Albion and Swindon Town during the 2003–04 season. Loaned to Swindon as part of the transfer to Spurs of Swindon player Leigh Mills, Yeates only played four games before being returned to White Hart Lane after a disagreement with then manager Andy King. He made his Spurs debut against Wolves on the final day of the 2003–04 Premier League season, setting up a goal for Robbie Keane. He made three first team appearances for Spurs. During the 2005–06 season, Yeates played on long-term loan at Colchester United, scoring five league goals, as they achieved promotion from League One. Prior to 2006–07 Yeates signed a two-year contract extension with Spurs. He joined Championship team Hull City on a season-long loan, but hardly featured for them before returning to his parent club midway through the season. He then signed a loan contract until the end of the 2006–07 season with another Championship side, Leicester City. He scored on his Leicester début at the Walkers Stadium in a 1–1 draw with Luton Town.[3] On 25 April 2007, having only featured 16 times for Leicester, and not once under caretaker manager Nigel Worthington, he was allowed to return to Spurs after being deemed surplus to requirements. On 3 July 2007 he completed a permanent move to Colchester United.[4] Yeates was set to sign for Crystal Palace Football Club, but due to the fact that he failed his medical, the transfer was abandoned. He had a productive year in League One, during which time, he scored the first competitive goal at the new Colchester Community Stadium in a game against Oldham.[5] Yeates then signed for newly relegated Championship team Middlesbrough for £500,000 on 26 June 2009.[6][7] He made his début for Middlesbrough on 7 August 2009 in a 0–0 draw with Sheffield United.[8] In and out of the team in the first part of the season, he scored what turned out to be his only goal for Middlesbrough in their 5–1 win over QPR in December 2009.[9] After finding himself surplus to requirements under new boss Gordon Strachan, Yeates signed for Boro's Championship rivals Sheffield United.[10] He scored his first goal for Sheffield United in a 2–1 defeat at Preston North End on 9 February 2010.[11] Having made the move, Yeates found himself playing no more regularly at Bramall Lane than at Middlesbrough. In an eighteen-month stay, he was in and out of the side and never showed any real consistency. By the time Micky Adams took over as manager of the Blades, Yeates was virtually frozen out of the first team altogether.[12] In July 2011, Yeates signed for Watford on a two-year deal for an undisclosed fee.[13] He scored on his debut against Burnley to put Watford 2–0 up, with the game finishing 2–2.[14] Yeates was a regular in the Watford side up until their FA Cup clash against Tottenham Hotspur on 27 January, in which he lost his place to Sean Murray. However, he continued to make substitute appearances and retained his place in the squad the following season under then-new manager, Gianfranco Zola. During this period, Yeates was primarily played in a central role rather than his usual wide position, with Yeates stating that he actually preferred this new position[15] On 7 June 2013, Watford announced that Yeates' contract would not be renewed and he was to be released as a free agent.[16] On 3 July 2013, Yeates signed a two-year contract with Bradford City,[17] the third time that Yeates had worked under manager Phil Parkinson, having previously played under him at Hull City and Colchester United.[18] Yeates made his Bradford debut on 3 August, the opening day of the season, playing 66 minutes of a 2–2 draw against Bristol City.[19] and scored his first goal for the club during his second appearance, in a 4–0 win against Carlisle United.[20] On 26 November, Yeates came off the bench to score his second goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Notts County.[21] On 25 August 2015, Yeates joined Oldham Athletic on a short-term deal.[22] Yeates scored one goal in 20 games for the club. On 7 January 2016, Yeates joined Blackpool on an initial 18-month deal from Oldham Athletic with the option for a further year.[23] On 30 January 2017, Yeates signed for Notts County.[24] On 28 June 2017, Yeates joined National League side Eastleigh on a two-year deal.[25] Yeates left Eastleigh to join AFC Fylde on 12 June 2019.[26] Yeates joined Bamber Bridge F.C. from AFC Fylde in September 2020.[27] Yeates joined the academy coaching staff at Fleetwood Town, working with the under-13s. He was appointed to a full-time role within the academy in September 2021.[28] He became the under-18s assistant coach in July 2022,[29] before becoming head coach of the under-18s in January 2023, guiding the team to the fifth round of the 2022–23 FA Youth Cup.[30] His late father Stephen played for Shelbourne, Shamock Rovers (two goals in 11 appearances in 1989–90), Athlone Town and Kilkenny City.[31] Colchester United","Mark Yeates","[""Mark Stephen Anthony Yeates"",""Colchester United"",""Spurs"",""Championship"",""player"",""winger"",""Hull

"74490",":Article"," José Luis López Panizo (6 February 1922 – 14 February 1990) was a Spanish footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. During 16 seasons he played for Athletic Bilbao, appearing in 413 official matches (179 goals) and winning seven major titles. Born in Sestao, Biscay, Panizo arrived at Athletic Bilbao's youth system at the age of 16 from Basque neighbours Sestao Sport Club, almost immediately being promoted to the first team. During 16 professional seasons he would play in 326 La Liga matches, scoring 136 goals (seven years in double digits); in the 1942–43 campaign, as Athletic won the double, he netted 12 in 24 games. He was a member of a noted forward line, headed by Zarra with support from Panizo, Rafael Iriondo and Piru Gaínza At the age of 33, Panizo moved to another Basque club, modest SD Indautxu of the second tier, closing out his career after one year. His teammates that season included younger brother Óscar, whose career was mostly spent at Barakaldo CF in the same division.[1] He died eight days after his 68th birthday, in Portugalete. Panizo made his debut for Spain on 23 June 1946, in a 0–1 friendly loss to the Republic of Ireland in Madrid. In the following seven years he earned a further 13 caps, scoring twice. Panizo was selected for the squad present at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, appearing four times as the nation reached the second group stage of the competition.","José Luis Panizo","[""José Luis López Panizo"",""midfielder"",""seasons"",""Spanish"",""Athletic Bilbao"",""SD Indautxu"",""matches"",""goals"",""age"",""neighbours"",""youth system"",""Basque"",""titles"",""seasons"",""double"",""team"",""matches"",""goals"",""age"",""campaign"",""games"",""line"",""support"",""Sestao"",""double digits"",""tier"",""Biscay"",""career"",""loss"",""debut"",""Óscar"",""Sestao Sport Club"",""Zarra"",""La Liga"",""Piru Gaínza"",""Rafael Iriondo"",""caps"",""competition"",""group stage"",""times"",""squad"",""Republic of Ireland"",""Spain"",""Madrid"",""teammates"",""nation"",""season"",""career"",""birthday"",""1950 FIFA World Cup"",""Portugalete"",""Barakaldo CF"",""1922"",""326"",""1942"",""23 June 1946"",""1950"",""43"",""12"",""68"",""1946"",""1950"",""179"",""33"",""6 February 1922"",""0"",""one"",""136"",""1"",""23"",""16"",""seven"",""16"",""6"",""1990"",""413"",""24"",""1942"",""1"",""seven"",""four"",""13"",""16"",""14"",""seven"",""eight"",""14 February 1990""]","0.002217721679829916","true","[0.81949985,0.024266914,0.014648255,0.014459661,0.0073564956,0.0070756865,0.005090871,0.005090871,0.0050656195,0.004451118,0.004451118,0.004327153,0.004311636,0.0037361358,0.003450377,0.003420324,0.0034082609,0.0034082609,0.0031574473,0.003031298,0.003031298,0.0030229993,0.0030229993,0.0029977062,0.002994284,0.0027738612,0.0026334818,0.0023800614,0.0020821125,0.0020821125,0.0020550918,0.0020228736,0.0017876314,0.0017706327,0.0016401594,0.0016401594,0.0014550792,0.0014529723,0.0014529723,0.0014529723,0.0014529723,0.0012308309,0.0012308309,0.0012308309,0.0012073261,0.0011500801,0.0011420032,0.0010415765,9.148341E-4,8.58725E-4,5.405748E-4,5.405748E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","José Luis Panizo - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Panizo",,,,,,,
"74491",":Article","  Ikechi Anya (born 3 January 1988) is a Scottish former professional footballer. A versatile player, Anya was fielded in a number of positions, including winger, wing-back and full-back.[3] He played for Wycombe Wanderers, Northampton Town, Watford and Derby County in England, as well as for Spanish clubs Celta de Vigo, Sevilla Atlético and Granada. Eligible to also represent Romania, Nigeria or England, he chose to play for the country of his birth, Scotland. Anya made 29 international appearances between 2013 and 2017, scoring three goals. Anya's father is a Nigerian research scientist of the Igbo ethnic group and his mother a Romanian economist. The couple met while studying in Bucharest. After finishing their studies, his parents moved to Scotland in the late 1980s for his father to obtain his doctorate in metallurgy.[4] Anya was born in Glasgow, Scotland and spent his early childhood in the Castlemilk area.[5] His mother, Mariana, states that as a very young boy Anya ""was kicking a ball in front of the house where he grew up in Glasgow from morning till night.""[6] The family moved to Oxford when he was seven years old after his father got a job at the University of Oxford. Anya maintained his fondness for Scotland, stating that whenever Scotland played England he would cheer ""Come on Scotland"".[5] His older brother, Chima, is a medical doctor.[6] Anya joined the Wycombe Wanderers youth team in the 2003–04 season, having been released by Oxford United. His performances in the youth team ensured that he was well talked about within the club, enough that he was given the number 28 shirt by then manager Tony Adams for the match at Southend United on 11 September 2004, becoming the club's youngest ever player at the age of 16.[7] Like Russell Martin, he committed his short-term future to the club, signing a two-year deal in June 2005 and whilst at Wycombe won Apprentice of the Year at the inaugural Football League Awards in 2006.[8] He was released in the summer of 2007 and signed for Oxford City, before being snapped up in January 2008 by Halesowen Town.

"74492",":Article","  Francis Gillot ( French pronunciation: [fʁɑ̃sis ʒilo]; born 9 February 1960) is a football manager and former player who most recently managed Ligue 2 team AJ Auxerre. As a player, he was a defender and predominantly associated with his time at Valenciennes and Lens while having brief periods with Strasbourg as well as Mulhouse before ending his career with Montauban. Since retiring he initially moved into youth coaching before moving into assistant management and then gaining his first head coaching position with his former club Lens. He has gone on to manage Sochaux and went on to win the 2012–13 Coupe de France with Bordeaux. Born in Maubeuge, France, Francis Gillot started his football career playing for the youth team of his local club Villiers-Siré-Nicole before joining the Valenciennes FC academy. At Valencianones he worked his way up into the senior team and in the 1978–79 season he started his professional career when he was included in the squad for the Ligue 1 outfit.[1] He eventually became a regular starter in the team's defence until they were relegated at the end of the 1981–82 French Division 1 season.[2] In the following season Gillot moved to top tier club RC Lens and experienced continental competitions with the club during his initial time with the team until the manager Jean Parisseaux decided he could be loan to RC Strasbourg in the 1988–89 campaign.[3] Upon his return to Lens the club found themselves in the second tier after experiencing relegation, however Gillot stayed with the team until they won promotion back into the top tier at the end of the 1990–91 French Division 2 season.[4] After spending several further seasons with Lens, Gillot was nearing the end of his career and he joined second tier club FC Mulhouse for a brief period before ending his career with lower league side FC Montauban. After retiring from playing Gillot, soon moved into coaching and joined the FC Sochaux U15 team as a trainer in 1996. He rose to be the team's U19 coach as well as the assistant coach to former head coaches Philippe Anziani and Jean Fernandez. After spending several years with the club he left in 2003 to go abroad to join United Arab Emirates football team Al Ain FC and be their assistant coach under fellow countryman Bruno Metsu. After spending one season abroad, Gillot returned to France as an assistant to Joël Müller at his former club RC Lens. At Lens, Gillot was promoted to the team's manager after Joël Müller resigned on 24 January 2005, and for the remainder of the season he guided the club to a seventh-place finish.[5] In his first full season Gillot would impress the fans with his outspokenness, confidence towards youth and offensive play that saw the team move up to fourth and qualification for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup.[6] This saw a growing expectation from the fans that the club could achieve more, however the club finished fifth and a point away from qualification for the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League.[7] Unable to exceed expectations Gillot resigned on 28 May 2007; however he still remained at the club as a recruiter. On 2 January 2008, Gillot joined struggling top-tier side Sochaux as their new manager after replacing Frédéric Hantz and in his debut season led the club to safety from the relegation zone. The following season the club would continue to struggle to avoid relegation; however Gillot was offered a two-year contract to remain with the team after avoiding relegation once again Sochaux's results significantly improved in the 2010–11 Ligue 1 campaign, which saw the club finish fifth.[8] Despite the club gaining qualification for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League and Gillot gaining a nomination for French coach of the year award, Gillot decided to publicly declare that he wanted to leave the club.[9] On 5 June 2011, he officially resigned from his post; however he immediately took over Bordeaux the following day, leading many from the French media to suspect that Gillot intentionally engineered the move to gain a larger operating budget from his new club and a higher salary.[10] On 6 June 2011, Gillot was officially signed on as the new head coach of Bordeaux with a two-year contract at the club.[11] In his debut season he guided them to a fifth-place finish and qualification for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League where he led them to the round of 16 before being knocked out by Benfica, 4–2 on aggregate.[12] His reign at the club reached its peak when he won the 2012–13 Coupe de France by beating Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C. 3–2 in the final, which saw him rewarded with a two-year extension to his contract.[13] In the following season, results within the league did not improve and the club were knocked out in the group stages of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League and after a 1–1 draw with Olympique de Marseille on 10 May 2014, he announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season.[14] Gillot was appointed as the new manager of AJ Auxerre on 1 June 2017.[15] He was sacked on 9 December 2017.[16] Montauban Lens Bordeaux","Francis

"74494",":Article","  Henri Grégoire Saivet (born 26 October 1990) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for French Ligue 2 club Pau and the Senegal national team. He is a former France youth international. Saivet began his career with Bordeaux, making his debut aged 17, and spending nine years at the club before being signed by English club Newcastle United. He made few appearances for Newcastle and was loaned out to Saint-Étienne, and Turkish clubs Sivasspor and Bursaspor before leaving in 2021. After a year without a club, he signed for Pau. In 2007, Saivet signed his first professional contract with Bordeaux, thus making him the youngest professional player in the history of the club.[3] He subsequently made his professional debut during the 2007–08 season, at the age of 17, in a league match against Lens. Saivet scored a goal in the final of the 2013 Coupe de France to help Bordeaux defeat Evian 3–2.[4] On 11 January 2016, Bordeaux manager Willy Sagnol confirmed that he gave Saivet permission to leave the club.[5] Later that day Saivet officially signed a five-and-half year contract with Newcastle United, joining for a reported fee of £5 million.[6][7] After playing just four matches starting twice in half a season with Newcastle United, Saivet joined Saint-Étienne on a season-long loan on 23 August 2016 without a purchase option given to Saint-Étienne.[8][9] On 23 August 2017, Saivet played his first game for Newcastle since 6 February 2016, starting an EFL Cup tie against Nottingham Forest.[10] He was recalled to the first team on 23 December and scored a free kick in a 3–2 Premier League win against West Ham.[11] On 25 August 2018, it was announced that Saivet would join Turkish club Bursaspor on loan for the season.[12] In June 2022, Saivet joined French club Pau.[13] He made his debut for Senegal on 14 August 2013.[14] Bordeaux[16] Senegal","Henri Saivet","[""Henri Grégoire Saivet"",""club"",""Bordeaux"",""club."",""team"",""midfielder"",""Newcastle United"",""Bursaspor"",""French"",""debut"",""Senegalese"",""Ligue 2"",""Pau"",""career"",""club"",""clubs"",""Willy Sagnol"",""Turkish"",""club"",""appearances"",""Saint-Étienne"",""season"",""debut"",""league match"",""contract"",""contract"",""age"",""goal"",""final"",""player"",""history"",""permission"",""fee"",""English"",""Sivasspor"",""club"",""team"",""tie"",""win"",""free kick"",""Evian"",""Coupe de France"",""debut"",""Lens"",""loan"",""matches"",""Premier League"",""EFL Cup"",""Nottingham Forest."",""West Ham."",""season"",""loan"",""purchase option"",""Pau."",""game"",""2007"",""2018"",""26 October 1990"",""2007"",""2013"",""11 January 2016"",""23 August 2016"",""23 August 2017"",""6 February 2016"",""23 December"",""25 August 2018"",""June 2022"",""14 August 2013"",""£5 million"",""2"",""2"",""17"",""2013"",""7"",""6"",""2017"",""2022"",""3"",""11"",""12"",""5"",""23"",""25"",""five"",""four"",""3"",""8"",""17"",""4"",""2021"",""6"",""23"",""14"",""2016"",""16"",""26"",""2007"",""08"",""11"",""2007"",""10"",""14"",""13"",""3"",""2016"",""2"",""2016"",""9"",""nine"",""1990"",""2013"",""23"",""5 million"",""2021""]","0.0030466324257331714","true","[0.6768348,0.029444505,0.025658421,0.02231534,0.020184927,0.017763851,0.014359432,0.014072603,0.013957271,0.010643772,0.01055836,0.01055836,0.009985917,0.008540162,0.0054182387,0.00539916,0.0049173594,0.0046517807,0.0036357588,0.003230494,0.0031589873,0.0029072203,0.002707163,0.002499922,0.0024693809,0.0022894533,0.0021960482,0.0021918898,0.0021918898,0.0021692123,0.0021692123,0.0020111187,0.0020111187,0.0019171884,0.0019104176,0.0017750106,0.0017254301,0.001515577,0.001515577,0.001515577,0.0015019013,0.0014752034,0.0013240944,0.0012982104,0.0012076685,0.001121712,0.0010198341,8.9573284E-4,8.9573284E-4,8.9573284E-4,8.9089875E-4,7.565303E-4,6.644518E-4,5.275676E-4,3.253173E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Henri Saivet - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Saivet",,,,,,,
"74495",":Article","  Alessandro Del Piero Ufficiale OMRI[3][4] ( Italian pronunciation: [alesˈsandro del ˈpjeːro]; born 9 November 1974) is an Italian former professional footballer who mainly played as a second stiker, although he was capable of playing in several offensive positions.[5][6][7][8] Since 2015, he has worked as a pundit for Sky Sport Italia.[9] A technically gifted[10] and creative supporting forward[11][12] who was also a free-kick specialist,[13][14] Del Piero won the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year award in 1998 and 2008 and received multiple nominations for the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year. A prolific goal-scorer, he is currently the second highest all-time Italian top-scorer in all competitions, with 346 goals, behind only Silvio Piola, with 390 goals; he is also the joint ninth highest goalscorer in Serie A history, with 188 goals, alongside Giuseppe Signori and Alberto Gilardino.[15][16][17][18][19][20] After beginning his career with Italian club Padova in Serie B in 1991, he moved to Juventus in 1993, where he played for 19 seasons (11 as captain), and holds the club records for most goals (290) and appearances (705). During his time at the club, he won six Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, four Supercoppa Italiana titles, the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the UEFA Intertoto Cup, and the Intercontinental Cup. After leaving the club in 2012, he also spent two seasons with Australian side Sydney FC; he retired in 2014, after a season with Delhi Dynamos FC in the Indian Super League. Del Piero has scored in every competition in which he has participated.[21] In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by Pelé as a part of FIFA's centenary celebrations.[22] In the same year, he was also voted into the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll, a list of the 50 best European players of the past 50 years.[23] Along with six awards in Italy for gentlemanly conduct,[24][25] he has also won the Golden Foot award, which pertains to personality as well as playing ability. At international level, Del Piero has also represented the Italy national team at three FIFA World Cups and four UEFA European Football Championships, most notably winning the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and reaching the final of UEFA Euro 2000 with Italy. He is the joint fourth highest scorer for the Italy national team, with 27 goals, alongside Roberto Baggio, and behind only Silvio Piola with 30 goals, Giuseppe Meazza with 33 goals, and Luigi Riva with 35 goals; with 91 appearances for Italy between 1995 and 2008, he is also his nation's eleventh-most capped player of all-time. In his career Del Piero scored 462 goals.[26] Del Piero was born in Conegliano, Veneto, the son of Gino, an electrician, and Bruna, a housekeeper.[27] He regularly played football in the backyard with two friends, Nelso and Pierpaolo, as a child. All three dreamed of becoming footballers but only Del Piero would eventually manage to do so.[28] His older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before an injury curtailed his career; he later worked as his younger brother's agent.[29] The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon, a rural home in San Vendemiano.[30] While growing up, Del Piero's family did not have much money for travelling abroad, so he considered being a lorry driver in order to see the world.[31] While playing for the local youth team of San Vendemiano,[32] Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper in order to gain more playing time. His mother thought it would be better for him to play in this role, as he would not sweat, and the possibility of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, the younger Del Piero was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and he switched to a forward role.[30] Del Piero began his rise to professional football in 1981, in the ranks of San Vendemiano. In 1988, Del Piero was first spotted by scouts, and he left home at the young age of 13 to play with the youth side of Padova.[33] He joined the senior side during the 1991–92 season, at the age of 16, and at the age of 17, he made his debut in Serie B against Messina, under manager Mauro Sandreani, on 15 March 1992, coming on as a substitute for Roberto Putelli.[34] The following season, on 22 November 1992, he scored his first professional goal in a 5–0 victory over Ternana.[35] In 1993, thanks to Giampiero Boniperti, Del Piero was bought by Juventus for five billion lire, with an overlap of 150 million lire per season.[36] In 1993, Del Piero transferred to Juventus and played for the Torinese club for 19 seasons until being released in the summer of 2012.[37] Although manager Giovanni Trapattoni insisted that he trained with the senior team, he initially played with the Primavera squad, which was coached by Antonello Cuccureddu, helping the Juventus Youth team to win both the 1994 Torneo di Viareggio, and the 1994 U-20 championship.[38] Del Piero made his Serie A debut against Foggia on 12 September 1993 under Trapattoni, as a substitute, and he scored his first goal in his next game against Reggiana on 19 September, after coming off the bench once again. On his full debut for Juventus, he netted a hat-trick against Parma.[39] After his promising performances, Del Piero began to be deployed with more continuity, and he managed 14 appearances for Juventus that season between youth matches, league matches, the Coppa Italia, and the UEFA Cup, scoring 5 goals, which all came in Serie A, as Juventus finished the season in second place in the league.[40] The 1994–95 Serie A season saw Marcello Lippi take over as Juventus manager, as well as the introduction of a new team of directors, made up of Giraudo, Roberto Bettega, and Luciano Moggi; Del Piero played a more prominent role for the club that season following Roberto Baggio's injury in November against Padova. Del Piero temporarily took his place in the first team alongside Gianluca Vialli and Fabrizio Ravanelli, flourishing at the opportunity given to him, and Juventus went on to claim their first scudetto in nine years. Del Piero scored 8 goals in Serie A that season, including a match-winning chipped volley against Fiorentina.[41] Del Piero was also able to achieve a rare double, and he captured the 1994–95 Coppa Italia with Juventus, defeating their season rivals Parma in the final, although they were defeated by Parma in the 1995 UEFA Cup Final.[42] During this time, Del Piero earned the nickname Pinturicchio due to the similarity between his own technical and tactical characteristics, and Baggio's creative style of play.[43] This nickname arose when former president Gianni Agnelli compared the emerging talent Del Piero to the renaissance artist Pinturicchio, who was the student of the great Italian renaissance artist Raphael (Raffaello), a nickname he had used to describe Baggio, to emphasise his elegance on the ball.[27] Del Piero placed fourth in the 1995 Ballon d'Or for his performances throughout the season.[44] With the Turin club, Del Piero won the Serie A eight times, although the 2005 and 2006 titles were revoked due to Juventus's involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal.[45] For the 1995–96 season, Del Piero was awarded Baggio's No. 10 squad number, which had also previously belonged to Michel Platini, following his departure to A.C. Milan. Del Piero scored 6 goals and provided 10 assists in Serie A, although Juventus finished the season in second place behind Milan. Del Piero did manage to capture the Supercoppa Italiana in 1995, over Parma, setting up Vialli's only goal of the match.[42] He also played a key role in helping Juventus to win the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, scoring 6 goals in the competition, and finishing as the second highest scorer of the tournament.[46] The following season, Del Piero followed these victories up with the 1996 UEFA Super Cup and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup, scoring goals in both finals, and being named Man of the Match in the latter final; he also won the Bravo Award (as the best U-23 player in European Competitions), and placed 4th in the 1996 Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year.[42][47][48] Del Piero also captured his second Serie A title with Juventus that season, and helped lead Juventus to their second consecutive Champions League final, although he was unable to start the match due to injury.[49] During the group stage, en route to the final, he helped Juventus to qualify for the quarter-finals a match early, scoring a goal in Juventus's 1–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, on 20 November 1996; this was the first time that an Italian team had defeated Manchester United at their home ground.[50] In the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final, he came off the bench to score a goal with a back-heel, which was unable to prevent Juventus from losing 3–1 to Borussia Dortmund.[51] Due to his performances throughout the calendar year, Del Piero received nominations for both the 1997 FIFA World Player of the Year, finishing sixth[52] and the 1997 Ballon d'Or.[53] Del Piero began the following campaign strongly by winning the 1997 Supercoppa Italiana, forming a strong offensive unit with Juventus teammates Zinedine Zidane in midfield, and newcomer Filippo Inzaghi upfront. The 1997–98 Serie A campaign was his best season yet, as he scored a joint career best of 21 goals in Serie A, and finished top scorer in the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League with 10 goals,[54] one of which included a freekick and a hat-trick against Monaco in the semi-finals.[55] With these goals, he helped Juventus to reach their third consecutive Champions League final, although Del Piero was not fully fit for the match,[56] and Juventus were once again defeated, falling 1–0 to Real Madrid from a strike by Predrag Mijatović on 20 May.[57] Domestic success, however, was achieved that season, after a tight battle with Inter Milan, as Juventus celebrated its 25th Serie A title over their Italian rivals, with Del Piero scoring a memorable and decisive individual match-winning goal during the controversial Derby d'Italia match.[58][59] Del Piero also managed a goal in the 1997–98 Coppa Italia that season, helping Juventus to the semi-finals, and finishing the season with a career best of 32 goals in all competitions. Del Piero was awarded the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year award for his performances,[60] and he was also nominated for the 1998 Ballon d'Or. During this time, he was nicknamed by the fans as Il Fenomeno Vero[61] (""The Real Phenomenon""), in comparison with the Brazilian striker Ronaldo, who was nicknamed Il Fenomeno (""The Phenom"") by supporters of rivals Inter Milan.[62] Juventus began the 1998–99 Serie A with a 2–1 defeat in the 1998 Supercoppa Italiana at the hands of Lazio, although Del Piero was able to score from a penalty.[63] On 8 November 1998, Del Piero picked up a serious knee injury in the final minutes of a 2–2 draw with Udinese;[64][65] this kept him out of action for the remainder of the season, as he managed only 2 goals. The club struggled without him, finishing the league season in a disappointing sixth place.[66] Juventus did manage to reach the semi-finals of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, losing out to eventual champions Manchester United.[65] Following his serious injury, Del Piero underwent a muscle strengthening regime in order to adapt to the increasingly more physical and athletic demands of twenty-first century football, which allowed him to compensate for the loss of some of his pace and agility.[67] Due to his dramatic weight gain and physical development during this period, as well as the club's success during the mid to late 90s,[68] Del Piero, along with several other Juventus players and staff members, was claimed of being involved in illegal performance-enhancing drug abuse;[68] after a lengthy investigation, the club's staff members incriminated were eventually cleared of all doping allegations in 2005.[69][70] During the next season under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Del Piero primarily served as an assist-man, providing 14 assists in Serie A, the most in the league that season, and 20 in all competitions.[71] He faced criticism, however, for his inability to score in open play following his injury the previous season, as only one of his 9 Serie A goals that season was in open play (a header against Parma), with the rest coming from penalties.[71] Furthermore, towards the end of the season, his once excellent attacking partnership with Inzaghi became less effective, due to Inzaghi's individualism, as well as the pair's lack of understanding and strained relationship both on and off the pitch.[72][73][74] Del Piero helped Juventus to capture the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup that season, which allowed Juventus to qualify for the UEFA Cup; overall, he scored 12 goals in all competitions, as Juventus narrowly missed out on the Serie A title. In 2000, Del Piero was the world's best-paid football player from salaries, bonuses, and advertising revenue.[75] The following season saw Juventus suffer another disappointing defeat losing out on the 2000–01 Serie A title once again, this time to Roma. Juventus and Del Piero began the season strongly, and Del Piero scored the winner on his season debut against Napoli on 30 September,[76] although he later suffered another injury and fell out of form, failing to score. On 18 February 2001, Del Piero broke his goal drought, scoring in an away win over Bari. Del Piero celebrated the goal by dedicating it to his father, who had recently died.[77] Del Piero refound his form towards the end of the season, although he was unable to help Juventus capture the Serie A title, despite scoring a goal in a 2–2 draw against Roma.[78] Del Piero was named Juventus captain upon Lippi's return to Juventus, and he formed a formidable offensive partnership with French striker David Trezeguet, who joined in 2000, and Czech playmaker Pavel Nedvěd, who arrived in 2001. Del Piero scored 16 goals and provided several assists, as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a 26th time on 5 May 2002, the last match day of the season; Juventus won the title over Roma and Inter Milan by a single point, after a 2–0 away victory over Udinese, with goals from top-scorer Trezeguet and Del Piero.[79] Del Piero managed 21 goals in all competitions, also scoring his 100th and 101st goals for Juventus that season, against Venezia, on 26 August 2001.[80] Del Piero also helped Juventus reach the Coppa Italia final that season, although Juventus were defeated by Parma.[81] Juventus's title success in 2002 enabled the club to automatically qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Juventus began the 2002–03 season by winning the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana over Parma, with Del Piero scoring two goals,[82] and Juventus were also able to successfully defend their Serie A title.[83] Del Piero scored his 100th goal in Serie A in a 2–1 win over Brescia on 27 April 2003.[84] In the UEFA Champions League, Juventus were placed in Group E alongside Newcastle United, Dynamo Kyiv, and Feyenoord.[85] Del Piero opened up his account in European competitions that season when he scored his side's second goal in a 5–0 victory over Dynamo Kyiv on 24 September, after combining with Nedvěd and Mauro Camoranesi.[86] On the next matchday, Juventus played host to Newcastle on 1 October and Del Piero hit a brace to help his club maintain the top spot in their group.[87] Juventus advanced to the second group stage where the club managed to progress, along with Manchester United, on goal differential over FC Basel and Deportivo de La Coruña.[88] Juventus then saw off Barcelona in the quarter-finals through an extra time goal by Marcelo Zalayeta,[89] and faced Spanish opposition again in the likes of defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals. The triumvirate attacking partnership proved wonders for Juventus, as the team overturned a 2–1 first leg deficit to record a 4–3 aggregate win as all three attacking stars netted in a 3–1 home win in the second leg.[90] Juventus faced Italian rivals AC Milan in the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final in Manchester on 28 May. After a goalless 120 minutes, the tie went to a penalty shoot-out, where Del Piero finished his spot-kick, but it wasn't enough, as Juventus fell 3–2 in the shoot-out.[91] The following season saw Juventus start strongly, winning the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana over Milan on penalties, although Juventus were knocked out in the round of 16 in the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, and finished the 2003–04 Serie A season in a disappointing third place. The club did manage to reach the 2004 Coppa Italia Final, only to be defeated by Lazio. Lippi left Juventus at the end of the season to take charge of the Italy national team.[83] After Euro 2004, Juventus manager Marcello Lippi was replaced by Fabio Capello. Capello was not convinced of Del Piero's fitness levels, and frequently benched him in favour of the younger, new offensive signing Zlatan Ibrahimović.[92] Despite his limited playing time, Del Piero still managed to score 14 goals, as Juventus won their 28th league title, due to his overhead assist to teammate David Trezeguet, which proved decisive in a match against Milan at the San Siro.[93] Del Piero also helped Juventus to reach the quarter-finals of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, only losing out to eventual champions Liverpool.[94] Several journalists and coaches believed that Del Piero was back to his best form in the 2005–06 Serie A,[95] as he managed 12 goals in Serie A, and 20 goals in all competitions, helping Juventus to defend the Serie A title. His role at Juventus changed during his second season under Capello, who preferred to use him as an immediate-impact substitute.[33] Due to his lack of playing time, Del Piero's relationship with Capello was often strained.[96] On 10 January 2006, Del Piero became the all-time leading goalscorer for Juventus when he scored three times in a Coppa Italia match against Fiorentina, taking his total goal tally for the club to 185. The previous record holder was Giampiero Boniperti, with 182 goals.[97] Del Piero also finished the season as the top scorer of the Coppa Italia, with 5 goals. Del Piero equalled José Altafini's Serie A record of six goals as a substitute after scoring in the final minute of Juventus' final game of the 2005–06 season,[98] before Juventus were forcibly relegated due to the Calciopoli scandal, also having their two most recent Serie A titles revoked.[45] After Juventus were demoted to Serie B and their two most recent scudetti were revoked, Del Piero pledged that he would stay to captain the team. He underlined that players should remain with the team, explaining that ""The Agnelli family deserve this, as do the fans and the new directors.""[99] While many key players such as Fabio Cannavaro, Emerson, Gianluca Zambrotta, Patrick Vieira, Zlatan Ibrahimović, and Lilian Thuram left, Del Piero chose to stay and help the club gain promotion.[100] ""A true gentleman never leaves his lady.""[101] Del Piero about the ""Old Lady"" Juventus during Calciopoli, 2006 Del Piero's first appearance after the 2006 FIFA World Cup triumph was in a Coppa Italia match against Cesena on 23 August 2006. As Juventus played in the Serie B for the 2006–07 season, the Coppa Italia campaign became increasingly important for the club in order to achieve a UEFA Cup spot. Having been on vacation beforehand, Del Piero started on the bench. Juventus and Cesena were locked on 1–1 when Del Piero entered in the 74th minute and after nine seconds, he scored the winning goal for Juventus.[102] Del Piero then came on as a substitute in the 61st minute during Juventus's next Coppa Italia match on 27 August, against Napoli. Once again Juventus came from behind, as Del Piero scored twice to give his team the lead. The match eventually went to penalties; although Del Piero scored his spot-kick, Napoli won 5–4 in the penalty shoot-out.[103] Despite starting the season with a nine-point penalty from the match-fixing scandal,[104] Juventus gained promotion to Serie A as Serie B champions;[105] Del Piero finished the league campaign as the top scorer of the 2006–07 Serie B season, with 20 goals.[106] During the season, Del Piero also managed his 200th goal with Juventus on 21 October 2006, in a 1–0 league victory over Frosinone.[107] ""Del Piero never really grows old.""[108] Diego Maradona, 2008 Following Juventus's return to Serie A, Del Piero was locked in months of fractious negotiations over the signing of a new contract with Juventus' new management. After successfully negotiating a new contract till 30 June 2010,[109] he was greeted with news of the birth of his first child, Tobias Del Piero.[110] This was quite a staggering turnaround in his fortunes, as only two weeks earlier, he was dropped by Claudio Ranieri for the Serie A match with Fiorentina,[111] and was then axed from Roberto Donadoni's Italy squad for the games with Georgia and South Africa.[112] On 15 December 2007, Del Piero scored two goals away at Lazio and was named to two consecutive Serie A teams of the week.[113] In February 2008, he scored the winning goal for Juventus from a free-kick in a 1–0 Serie A home victory over Roma.[114] On 6 April 2008, he set a new appearance record for Juventus, overtaking Gaetano Scirea's previous tally of 552 matches in all competitions.[115][116] In April, he registered seven goals in five Serie A matches, including a hat-trick in a 0–4 away win over Atalanta.[117] On the final weekend of the 2007–08 season, Del Piero scored a brace against Sampdoria in a 3–3 draw.[118] These two goals were crucial, as it took him to 21 goals for the season, thus winning him the Capocannonieri prize in Serie A for the first time in his illustrious career, beating the likes of teammate David Trezeguet (20 goals) and Marco Borriello (19 goals), also matching his highest seasonal tally in Serie A since the 1997–98 season.[119] He became only the second Italian ever to win consecutive Capocannoniere titles in two different leagues – former Juventus and 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi being the other. (Coincidentally, Rossi also won the Capocannoniere titles like Del Piero – first in Serie B and then in Serie A). On 26 July, Del Piero was awarded the Scirea Award.[120] Juventus finished the 2007–08 Serie A season in third place, which allowed them to qualify for the UEFA Champions League the following season. Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri remarked that Del Piero would have as good a season, or an even better one, than the previous term. In August 2008, Del Piero announced that he would try to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40.[121] Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit.[122] On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.[123][124] On 5 November 2008, Juventus and Real Madrid squared off at Santiago Bernabéu in the Champions League. The Italians won 0–2, their first away win against Madrid since 1962, and Del Piero was a key performer, scoring both goals, and drawing praise from Ranieri, as well as Real Madrid's coach Bernd Schuster.[125] As he left the pitch after being substituted, fans from both sides gave him a standing ovation.[126] Juventus's Champions League campaign ended in disappointment, as they were eliminated by Chelsea in the second round. Despite converting a penalty in the second leg in Turin, Del Piero was unable to prevent Juventus from losing 3–2 on aggregate.[127] On 29 November 2008, Del Piero scored his 250th goal for Juventus from a penalty, in a 4–0 home win over Reggina.[128] In the league, Juventus were mostly challenging Milan for second place and an automatic Champions League spot. Most notably, Del Piero inspired Juventus to a 3–0 win over Siena in their penultimate game of the season, scoring a brace and setting up Claudio Marchisio for the youngster's third goal of the season to end their run of seven winless matches in Serie A.[129] Juventus then went on to defeat Lazio 2–0 and clinch the second place spot in Serie A over Milan, determined by their head-to-head record.[130] On 17 July 2009, Del Piero extended his contract with Juventus by one more year until 30 June 2011 in Pinzolo while training for pre-season, thus practically ensuring that he would retire at the club with which he started his professional career.[131] During his renewal, he said: ""I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing for as long as I can and I'm certain that for at least two more years I will be at the top level."" On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa.[132] Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.[133][134] On 14 March 2010, Del Piero recorded his 300th and 301st career goals during a 3–3 draw with Siena, with the first two goals coming in the second and seventh minutes.[135] On 30 October 2010, he recorded his 179th Serie A goal, helping his side to a 2–1 win at Milan, breaking the record of club legend Giampiero Boniperti as Juventus's top scorer in Serie A, and further cementing his status as the most prolific goalscorer in Juventus history.[136] On 5 February 2011, with his substitution against Cagliari, Alessandro Del Piero became the most capped Juventus player, edging out former Juventus legend Giampiero Boniperti.[137] Del Piero was the third most capped active player in the Serie A at the time, behind Javier Zanetti and Francesco Totti, respectively. On 5 May 2011, he signed a new one-year contract to stay at the Juventus Arena. His previous deal was due to expire on 30 June 2011.[138] On 24 May 2011, Del Piero and Juventus played against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a friendly match being former England defender Gary Neville's testimonial match. Del Piero was substituted after 65 minutes to a standing ovation from the United supporters.[139] Juventus confirmed on 18 October 2011 that the 2011–12 Serie A would be Del Piero's last season with the club.[140] The 2011–12 season under new manager Antonio Conte, his former Juventus teammate, saw Del Piero being used sparingly, and mainly as a substitute, because of the summer arrival of forward Mirko Vučinić from Roma. In the club's opening match of the season against Parma on 11 September, he assisted Simone Pepe's goal in an eventual 4–1 home win.[141][142] Del Piero scored his first goal in the new Juventus Stadium on 24 January 2012, in a 3–0 win over Roma in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia.[143] Later in the season, Del Piero stated that he was surprised at Juventus president Andrea Agnelli's announcement regarding the club's decision not to offer him a new contract.[144] In the second leg of Juventus's clash with Milan in the Coppa Italia semi-finals, Del Piero finished off a brilliant move by Juventus as they secured a 2–2 draw to progress to the final with a 4–3 aggregate win.[145] On 25 March, Del Piero helped Juventus defeat Inter Milan by scoring the second goal of the match in a 2–0 victory, his first goal of the Serie A season.[146] In Juventus' match against Lazio on 11 April, Del Piero replaced Vučinić in the second half, making his 700th appearance for Juventus,[147] and then went on to score from a free kick to earn his side a 2–1 victory; the result also enabled Juventus to return to the top of the Serie A table.[148] On 13 May, Del Piero started Juventus's final league game of the season against Atalanta, marking the occasion and the victory of their 28th Serie A title by scoring a goal.[149] Twenty-seven minutes into the match, Del Piero picked the ball up at the edge of the penalty box and placed a shot past Giorgio Frezzolini to make the score 2–0, helping Juventus to go undefeated in Serie A that season.[150] He was substituted off after 59 minutes to an emotional response from both sets of players and supporters, as he made a lap of honour around the pitch. This was Alessandro Del Piero's final Serie A appearance for Juventus.[151][152] Del Piero's final match for Juventus was in the Coppa Italia Final on 20 May against Napoli, which ended in a 2–0 victory to the Neapolitans. Del Piero was substituted in the 67th minute for Vučinić as his Juventus career came to an end; he received a standing ovation from both the Juventus and Napoli fans.[153][154] Following the game, he confirmed that after his 19-year spell with Juventus, he did not plan to retire. He then left the club and became a free agent. In total, Del Piero made a club record of 705 appearances for Juventus across all competitions, scoring a record 290 goals, and providing 134 assists in all competitions throughout his career with the club; he also scored 188 goals and provided 105 assists in 478 Serie A appearances with the Turin club.[155][156] In addition to these records, Del Piero is also Juventus's top scorer and second highest appearance holder in the UEFA Champions League, behind only Buffon, with 44 goals in 92 appearances; he is also the top scorer and appearance holder for Juventus in European Competitions, with 50 goals in 125 appearances, in International competitions, with 54 goals in 131 appearances, and in the Supercoppa Italiana, with 3 goals in 6 appearances. He is the club's top-scorer in Serie B, with 21 goals, and the club's second highest scorer in the Coppa Italia, with 25 goals, behind Pietro Anastasi.[157][158] Alongside Giuseppe Signori and Alberto Gilardino, Del Piero is also the ninth highest all-time goalscorer in Serie A, and he is currently the joint all-time top scorer in the Supercoppa Italiana, alongside Samuel Eto'o, Andriy Shevchenko, and Carlos Tevez.[159] As of April 2023, he is the seventeenth highest UEFA Champions League all-time goalscorer, with 42 goals.[160] Del Piero refused the board's offer to retire the No. 10 shirt in his honour, saying: ""I've really had so much that I would never want it to be retired, this way, every child can dream one day of wearing it.""[161] On 30 June, Del Piero wrote an open letter to the Juventus fans thanking them for almost two decades of support, stating: ""Above all what remains is the fans, you who are Juventus. That jersey that I loved and will always love, that I desired and respected ... From tomorrow I will no longer be a Juventus player, but I will always be one of you. Now a new adventure begins and I am as fired up as I was 19 summers ago.""[162] On 5 September 2012, Del Piero signed a two-year deal with Sydney FC. He was paid approximately AU$3.5 million for each of his first two seasons, and therefore became the highest-paid footballer to ever play in Australia.[163] Del Piero had been linked to Liverpool prior to signing for Sydney, but later revealed due to his memories of Heysel he would not have been able to move to the club.[164] Upon signing for Sydney FC, Del Piero said: ""It's a special day for me. I am happy to announce that I just signed for two years for Sydney FC. This is a very big moment for me because I want to continue my career in a new part of the world where I can make a major contribution and help grow the game I love.""[165] After the announcement of the transfer to Sydney FC, Juventus wished good luck to their former captain.[166] Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi said they were saddened by his departure.[167][168] Sydney FC chairman Scott Barlow said: ""The signing of Alessandro Del Piero is a big moment for this club and, we believe, a historic moment for football in Australia, I wouldn't like to go into the details of the contract, but this does represent the largest professional sporting contract in Australian history and the numbers that have been discussed aren't too far off the mark.""[169] Football Federation Australia chief executive Ben Buckley said that this signing would be crucial for the growth of Australian Football, both economically and technically.[169] Ian Crook, manager of Sydney FC, said he would build the forward set-up around the Italian, who would be given licence to pull the strings, adding: ""We're not going to reinvent the wheel here. He's played 19 years for one of the biggest four or five clubs in the world, as a No. 10 or a No. 9. We're not going to change that.""[170] FIFA President Sepp Blatter sent his best wishes to Del Piero and his new club.[171] On 6 October 2012, Del Piero made his A-League debut with Sydney FC in a 2–0 away loss against Wellington Phoenix.[172] Del Piero scored his first goal for the club from a free-kick in 3–2 loss to Newcastle Jets on 13 October, in his first home game for Sydney.[173] The match against Newcastle featured hero-cam, which allowed the viewer to track Del Piero's movements with one camera throughout the game.[174] On 20 October, Del Piero scored the winning goal against Western Sydney Wanderers FC (1–0), making history with the first goal in the first Sydney Derby.[175] On 19 January 2013, Del Piero scored four goals and also provided one assist in Sydney's 7–1 win against Wellington Phoenix; this was the first time he had scored more than three goals in a single match, and after being substituted, the fans gave him a standing ovation.[176] On 10 February, Del Piero broke the club's record for most goals in a single season, scoring his eleventh goal of the season in a 2–1 home win over Brisbane Roar.[177] Despite his record-breaking tally of 14 goals in 24 appearances, Del Piero was unable to help Sydney qualify for the play-offs at the end of the season.[178] On 21 February, Del Piero renewed his contract until 2014.[179] Del Piero was named Sydney's captain for their 2013–14 season.[178][180] On 11 October 2013, Del Piero scored the opening goal of the 2013–14 A-League season, the game-winner in a 2–0 victory over Newcastle Jets, also setting up Joel Chianese's goal.[178][181] Alessandro went on to score 10 goals in total for Sydney FC in the 2013–14 season, which earned him the Sydney FC Golden Boot;[182] he helped the club qualify for the finals series, setting up both of his team's goals in the final match of the regular season on 13 April 2014, a 2–1 home win over Perth Glory, before being released of his contract at Sydney FC.[183] His final match with Sydney came in a 2–1 loss to Melbourne Victory in an Elimination final at Docklands Stadium on 18 April, courtesy of Gui Finkler's injury time winner.[184] On Sunday 10 August 2014, Del Piero captained the Hyundai A-League All Stars against his club of almost 20 years, Juventus, in Sydney, in front of over 55,000 people at ANZ Stadium. Del Piero was substituted off at the 63rd minute of the match for David Williams, to a standing ovation.[185] In April 2015, Del Piero was named to Sydney FC's team of the decade and to the AFC team of the decade.[186][187] On 23 August 2014, it was reported that Delhi Dynamos, an Indian side that was set to play in the inaugural Indian Super League season, was in talks with Del Piero.[188] His brother, Stefano Del Piero said, ""During the last (few) weeks, we have received inquiries from several teams, not only from India but also from other countries. There is a lot of interest in Alessandro.""[189] On 28 August 2014, he officially signed for the Delhi-based outfit, signing a four-month deal.[190] He reportedly is the highest paid player in the history of Indian football.[191][192][193] Del Piero made his debut for the Delhi Dynamos on 14 October in a 0–0 draw against Pune City, a side which featured his former Juventus teammate David Trezeguet.[194] On 9 December, Del Piero scored his first and only Delhi Dynamos goal, netting directly from a free kick, in a 2–2 draw against Chennaiyin.[195] Del Piero made 10 appearances throughout the season as Delhi finished in fifth place, failing to reach the play-offs by a single point.[196] In October 2015, after almost a year without a club, Del Piero officially communicated his retirement from professional football, also stating his intention to pursue a coaching career.[5] Del Piero is currently Italy's joint fourth all-time leading scorer, along with Roberto Baggio, with 27 goals in 91 appearances, with 2 goals for Italy coming in 12 World Cup matches and 1 goal in 13 European Championship matches;[197] alongside Enrico Chiesa, he also holds the unique record for the most goals scored by an Italian international as a substitute (5).[198] Del Piero initially played for the Italian U-21 side on 12 occasions, scoring 3 goals, and was a member of the team that qualified for and later won the 1996 European Under-21 Championship, appearing in the quarter-finals.[197] Del Piero made his senior debut under Arrigo Sacchi at the age of 20, on 25 March 1995, in a 4–1 win over Estonia in a Euro 1996 qualifying match.[197] Del Piero scored his first goal for Italy on 15 November 1995, in a 4–0 win over Lithuania in a Euro 1996 qualifying match.[197] His tournament debut was at UEFA Euro 1996, where he made his only appearance in the first half of the team's 2–1 win in the opening group match against Russia, playing as a left-winger in midfield, wearing the number 14 shirt, before being substituted at half-time by Roberto Donadoni.[199][200] The next year, Del Piero was part of the Italy team that took part in the friendly ""Tournoi de France"" tournament from 3 to 11 June 1997 under Cesare Maldini. Del Piero scored two goals in a 3–3 draw against Brazil,[201] and scored from a penalty against France in the 90th minute,[202] finishing the tournament as top-scorer with 3 goals, although Italy finished in last place.[203] Del Piero competed with fan favourite Roberto Baggio for an attacking spot in the starting 11 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, while struggling to recover from an injury suffered during the 1998 Champions League final with Juventus; Del Piero missed out on Italy's 2–2 opening draw against Chile, and was temporarily replaced by Baggio.[204] He made his first World Cup appearance in the second group match, a 3–0 defeat of Cameroon, coming on for Baggio in the second half, wearing the number 10 shirt, and contributing to Christian Vieri's final goal.[205] In the final group game against Austria, Del Piero won his first start, setting up Vieri's opening goal of the match from a free-kick as Italy won 2–1 to top their group and seal a passage into the next round, avoiding reigning champions Brazil; he was substituted by Baggio in the second half.[206] Italy reached the quarter-finals after defeating Norway 1–0, as Del Piero started the match alongside Vieri once again, coming off for Enrico Chiesa in the 77th minute.[207] Italy eventually fell to hosts and eventual champions France on penalty kicks, following a 0–0 draw; Del Piero was criticised for his performance and was substituted in the second half by Baggio once again.[208] Del Piero was part of Dino Zoff's Italy's squad that reached the final of UEFA Euro 2000. Although he was primarily used as a substitute for either Francesco Totti or Stefano Fiore, Del Piero appeared in every match of the tournament, and he wore the number 10 shirt. On 11 June, Del Piero came on as a substitute for Fiore in the 30th minute in Italy's opening Group B 2–1 win against Turkey, hitting the cross-bar from a free-kick.[209] In the final group game, Del Piero started the match and scored the winner with a notable goal against Sweden, taking it past two players before curling the ball into the top corner from outside the area with a left-footed strike; Del Piero also set up Luigi Di Biagio's opener from a corner.[210] Del Piero made his second start of the tournament for Italy in their semi-final against co-hosts, Netherlands, which Italy won on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra-time.[211] In the final, he come on as a substitute in the second half and missed two gilt-edged chances in Italy's 2–1 loss to France in extra time, and was criticised by the Italian press.[212] Del Piero returned to the international scene in the 2002 FIFA World Cup under Giovanni Trapattoni after winning the scudetto with Juventus.[213] He scored the decisive goal against Hungary, which sealed Italy's qualification for the finals.[214] Del Piero appeared as a substitute in Italy's opening win against Ecuador, wearing the captain's armband for part of the match.[215] He instantly scored with a header against Mexico, after coming on as a substitute, an equalising goal which saved Italy from the ignominy of a first round exit in their final group match.[216] The goal sent Italy through to the second round, where they were eliminated by a golden goal in a controversial match against co-hosts South Korea, a match during which Del Piero started alongside Totti and Vieri.[217][218] Del Piero took part in 6 of Italy's 2004 European Qualifying matches, scoring 5 goals, and was called up for the Italy squad that would participate in UEFA Euro 2004 in Portugal.[219][220] Del Piero started all three matches, wearing the captain's armband in Italy's final win over Bulgaria, and was involved in Cassano's injury time match-winning goal, although Italy were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.[42][221][222] Del Piero took part in the 2006 FIFA World Cup under manager Marcello Lippi,[223] appearing in five matches, and two out of the three group stage matches; he made his first start of the competition in a 1–0 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June.[42] On 4 July, Del Piero entered as a substitute near the end of regulation and scored Italy's second goal in a 2–0 semi-final win over host Germany.[224][225] In the final against France, which ended 1–1 after extra time, Del Piero scored a penalty in the shootout as Italy won the tournament for the fourth time.[226] He admitted afterwards that winning the World Cup was his childhood dream.[227] As of 2008, Del Piero has captained Italy seven times (including during UEFA Euro 2008). He also initially regularly wore the number 10 shirt, in particular under Maldini and Zoff, but later gave it to Totti after Euro 2000, and switched to the number 7 for the 2002 World Cup, as it was the first number he wore at the start of his career.[228] Even though the number 10 shirt was vacated after Totti retired from the national team in July 2007, Del Piero denied any interest in taking back the number, saying he was satisfied with the number 7 jersey.[229] In May, he was recalled by popular demand to Italy's UEFA Euro 2008 squad in Austria and Switzerland under manager Roberto Donadoni, after a nine-month absence from international duty, and thus became the second Italian player, after Paolo Maldini, to participate in seven major international tournaments (Euro 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008; World Cup 1998, 2002, 2006).[42] Although Del Piero was mostly on the substitutes' bench at Euro 2008, he started in Italy's second group match against Romania as the squad's captain.[230] In the first group match against the Dutch, he came on for the under-performing Antonio Di Natale and made an immediate impact, including several efforts on goal; however, he could not prevent Italy from losing 3–0.[231] Italy qualified through the group stage in second-place behind the Netherlands, eliminating Romania and France.[232] In the quarter-final against eventual champions Spain, Del Piero made a substitute appearance during extra-time, and with the game ending in a 0–0 draw, it was decided by a penalty shootout in which Spain won 4–2.[233] On 20 August 2008, Del Piero won his 90th cap for Italy in friendly against Austria under Lippi, becoming only the fifth Italy player to reach this landmark at the time.[234] Despite announcing his intention to carry on playing until the age of 40, he was excluded from Lippi's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. Del Piero's final appearance for Italy came in a 2–0 win against Georgia in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier on 10 September 2008; he came on for Di Natale in the 56th minute and later set up Daniele De Rossi's second goal of the match.[235][236] In 2013, the Italy national team coach at the time, Cesare Prandelli, stated that he would consider calling Del Piero up for the 2014 World Cup, although he was ultimately excluded from the Italian squad that participated at the tournament in Brazil.[237] ""[Del Piero] is different to Zinedine Zidane. He likes to play, he feels it in his soul. Between him and the Frenchman, I choose him.""[238] Diego Maradona, 2012 Due to his creative style of play, eye for goal, flair, and technical skill, Del Piero was known as a ""fantasista"" in Italy.[239] His hard-working playing style was regarded by critics as creative in attacking, assisting many goals as well as scoring himself, as opposed to just ""goal poaching"".[27] Because of his technical characteristics, link-up play, and ability at one–twos, Del Piero usually played as a supporting-striker, which was his preferred role,[239] although he was a tactically versatile forward, with good movement and clinical finishing, who was capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and who also established himself as a prolific goalscorer throughout his career. He was also occasionally deployed between the midfield and the strikers as a playmaking attacking midfielder, known in Italy as the trequartista position, due to his vision, passing range, ball control, dribbling ability (in particular in one on one situations) and creativity, although he often stated that this was not his preferred position. As such, Del Piero's former Juventus teammate and manager Didier Deschamps described him as a ""nine and a half"" in 2006, a description that Michel Platini had previously also used to describe Roberto Baggio, to indicate that Del Piero's favoured role was somewhere between that of a striker (who traditionally wore the number nine shirt) and an attacking midfielder (who traditionally wore the number ten shirt), namely that of a second striker.[240][241][242][243][244][245][246][247] In this free role, he was also often given licence to drift onto the wings and cut inside to shoot on goal with his stronger right foot.[248] In addition to his technical, offensive, and creative qualities, Del Piero was known for his defensive work-rate,[249] and his crossing accuracy,[250] as well as his ability to use either foot.[251] Del Piero is widely regarded by players, pundits, and managers as one of the greatest players of his generation[252][253] and as one of the best Italian players of all time;[83][254] He is also considered to be Juventus's greatest player ever by some pundits.[255] A precocious talent,[256] in his youth, Del Piero played in the ""trident-attack"" of Lippi's 4–3–3 formation, along with veterans Vialli, Baggio, and Ravanelli, as a striker, or more frequently as an outside forward on the left wing.[245][257][258] With the arrival of Zidane in the advanced midfield playmaking role, Juventus's formation changed to a 4–4–2 system, and Del Piero partnered alongside a more offensive striker up front, such as Christian Vieri and subsequently Inzaghi, as either a supporting forward or as an out-and-out striker.[258][259][260][261] After losing some of his explosive pace, speed of execution, flair, and agility following his injury in 1998, Del Piero performed a muscle strengthening regime, and he took on a more creative role, in combination with playmaker Zidane, functioning in a free position, just in front of the attacking midfielder and behind the main striker Inzaghi, under Ancelotti, in the club's 3–4–1–2 formation;[241][247][258][262][263][264] although he was accused by some in the media of not living up to his potential following his injury, due to his decrease in goalscoring,[265][266] he successfully adapted to his new creative attacking role as an assist provider.[267][268][269] As Juventus's playing style continued to change during Lippi's second stint with Juventus starting in 2001, Del Piero partnered with Zidane's replacement, Nedvěd, in a free creative role in front of the midfield, or occasionally on the left flank, as a supporting striker in a fluid 4–4–2 formation, with Trezeguet upfront; he subsequently continued to play a similar role under Capello and later managers, and was even occasionally used in a more offensive role as a main striker, although he became increasingly deployed as a substitute due to his advancing age.[258][270][271][272][273] Del Piero was also employed occasionally as a winger in a 4–4–2 formation throughout his career, in particular during his time under Sacchi with the Italy national football team.[274] Regarding the contrast between Del Piero's world–class performances in his youth and his initial struggle to replicate the heights he achieved prior to his career–threatening injury in 1998, Roberto Beccantini noted in a Treccani profile on Del Piero: ""There were two Del Pieros: one was the unmatchable fantasista, capable of scoring unforgettable goals and producing extraordinary assists; the other is the forward that, after Zeman's allegations of his use of performing enhancing drugs and the serious injury he suffered to his left knee on 8 November 1998 in Udine, struggled to find himself and went from his 21 league goals of the 1997–98 season, a personal record, to only one goal in open play (plus 8 penalties scored) during the 1999–2000 season."" He also noted that Del Piero struggled to replicate his club performances with Juventus at international level with Italy, in particular in major tournaments.[256][275] Despite his injury struggles, Del Piero also stood out for his longevity throughout his career, and drew praise in the media for his consistent goalscoring and the high–level of performance he managed to maintain even into his late 30s.[276] In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise from pundits throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus,[277] and served as the team's captain despite his shy personality;[256] he also drew acclaim in the media for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.[278] ""Del Piero (is the best Italian player), we're the same age and I've followed his whole career.""[279] Ryan Giggs, 2012 Del Piero was a free kick and penalty kick (62 goals from penalties) specialist.[265] He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio.[280] Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal;[281] he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus,[43][282][283] and was also influenced by the free kick technique of one of his idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having it touched by a teammate first.[284] Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team).[240][285] He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović.[286] The football media refer to a ""Del Piero Goal"" (Gol alla Del Piero in Italian), a style of scoring involving a dribbling approach from the flank, followed by a precise, curling lob into the far top corner of the goal, from outside the area, with a player's stronger foot after cutting into the centre;[287][288] as such, this area of the pitch also became known as the ""Del Piero Zone"" in the media (Zona Del Piero in Italian).[241] This association came about as Del Piero had scored several goals in this manner, both in open play and from set-pieces, with his right foot after cutting in from the left flank, during his first two seasons under Lippi, in particular during Juventus's victorious 1995–96 Champions League campaign;[289] Del Piero continued to score similar goals throughout his career,[290][291] and the ""Del Piero Goal"" label[292] has also been used to describe similar goals by other players.[293] In his later career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by running to the touchline in front of the fans with his arms out-stretched, and sticking out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd.[294][295][296][297] Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit,[298] and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions,[299] to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season,[77] and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.[216] Del Piero is married to Sonia Amoruso and the two have been together since 1999 and married in 2005.[300] They have three children, son Tobias (born 2007),[110][301] daughter Dorotea (born 2009),[302] and son Sasha (born 2010).[303] When the Olympic Flame for the 2006 Winter Olympics passed through Turin, Del Piero was a torchbearer.[304] He has an interest in sports outside of football, particularly basketball, and in turn has gained fans outside of football; sport icons such as NBA star Steve Nash and cyclist Eddy Merckx have stated that they are fans of Del Piero.[305][306] Del Piero has a keen interest in music. He has recorded some of his own albums.[307] Along with Marco Materazzi, Del Piero appeared on stage at a Rolling Stones show in Milan shortly after Italy's World Cup win.[308] He is a good friend of musician and singer Noel Gallagher and a fan of his former band Oasis; Del Piero appears in the Oasis video alongside Anthony Skeete ""Lord Don't Slow Me Down"".[citation needed] One of Del Piero's inspirations as a youngster was Japanese football manga Captain Tsubasa.[309] In 2012, Del Piero participated in the Save the Dream project against corruption in the sport and spoke about this at Sorbonne during the Sport Integrity Symposium.[310][311] Since March 2018, Del Piero has been running an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles called No.10, representing his jersey No. 10.[312] [313] Del Piero has promoted and supported a number of charities. In 1998, he donated 5.2 million lire to Fondazione Bambini in Emergenza for abandoned children and victims of AIDS by auctioning his Juventus shirt. [314] In 2001, he was ambassador for Un gol per la ricerca, a cancer-research project.[315] In 2006, he was AIRC testimonial for the cancer research and in recognition of this, he has received from the President of Italy a prize of Believe in Research.[316] In 2008, he participated in a golf tournament organized by the foundation of Gianluca Vialli and Massimo Mauro for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research.[317] In 2009, he played a friendly match at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino with his team Ale 10+; the proceeds (€180,000) were donated to solidarity projects.[318] In 2010, Del Piero auctioned off his Juventus shirt number 10 for the foundation Un Campo per L'Aquila.[319] On 1 April 2011, he launched the ale10friendsforjapan project, which he designed to help Japanese earthquake victims creating a website to sell T-shirts and collecting $303,880.[320] In 2011, he participated in the golf tournament Fondazione Sant'Anna Cup – Crescere insieme for the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital Sant'Anna.[321] On 21 July 2012, he played a friendly match at Kashima Stadium organized by J. League (Del Piero scored one goal and he left the field with a standing ovation); the collection was donated to the Japanese earthquake victims of 2011.[322] Del Piero was testimonial of ADISCO, for the donation of umbilical cord blood,[323][324] and testimonial of 1GOAL for the education of poor children.[324] In 2015, in honour of Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna, Del Piero facilitated and inaugurated the AYRTON exhibition in Turin, open between February and May 2015. The exhibition is curated by, and with tickets proceeds going to, the Instituto Ayrton Senna charity.[325] Del Piero has featured in various advertisements and is under contract with German sports equipment manufacturer Adidas, Uliveto water, Fiat, Japanese motorbike company Suzuki, Pepsi,[326] Bliss, Cepu, Walt Disney, and Upper Deck.[327] In 2006, Del Piero appeared in a television commercial for the Japanese motor scooter Suzuki Burgman together with the sports agent Andreas Goller.[328] He is also known for his sense of humour and is a popular guest at Italian comedy shows such as Paperissima and Striscia la notizia. He featured in the film L'allenatore nel pallone 2 and in the show La sai l'ultima di Totti, a series of short comedy sketches created by his good friend and Roma captain Francesco Totti in which the two of them and national teammates former A.C. Milan defender Alessandro Nesta, Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, and striker Antonio Cassano would tell jokes and anecdotes about one another.[citation needed] Del Piero was featured on the cover of EA Sports FIFA Football 2004 video game, alongside Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho,[329] and on the cover of the Italian edition of the FIFA World Cup 2006 video game.[330] He was also named in the Ultimate Team Legends in FIFA 17.[331] He was one of the two stars featured on the cover of the Italian version of PES 2010 video game, the other being Barcelona's Lionel Messi.[332] In 2015, Del Piero joined Sky Sport Italia as a pundit.[9] In 2017, he appeared in the Netflix docu-series called First Team: Juventus.[333] In 2018, Konami announced that Del Piero would feature in their football video game Pro Evolution Soccer 2019 as one of the new myClub Legends.[334][335] Starting in 2020, Del Piero joined ESPN as a football analyst for ESPN FC and UEFA Euro 2020.[336] Juventus Primavera[349] Juventus[349] Italy U21 Italy[349] Individual Orders 5th Class/Knight: Cavaliere Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana: 2000[3] 4th Class/Officer: Ufficiale Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana: 2006[4] CONI: Golden Collar of Sports Merit: 2006[380]","Alessandro Del Piero","[""Alessandro Del Piero Ufficiale OMRI"",""footballer"",""Juventus"",""Italy"",""goals"",""Serie A"",""season"",""Roberto Baggio"",""shirt"",""Marcello Lippi"",""team."",""Italian"",""Coppa Italia"",""David Trezeguet"",""free-kick specialist"",""goal-scorer"",""seasons"",""match"",""play"",""Pinturicchio"",""goal"",""goals"",""goals"",""Giampiero Boniperti"",""goals"",""goals"",""UEFA Champions League"",""Filippo Inzaghi"",""Zinedine Zidane"",""Ballon d'Or"",""competition"",""club"",""goalscorer"",""Serie B"",""Raphael"",""Francesco Totti"",""campaign"",""FIFA 100"",""goals"",""FIFA World Player of the Year"",""Sydney FC"",""squad"",""title"",""intention"",""Real Madrid"",""UEFA Cup"",""Sky Sport Italia."",""some"",""goals"",""goals"",""goals"",""goals"",""goals"",""goals"",""goals"",""goals"",""goalkeeper"",""goal"",""place"",""goals"",""award"",""Manchester United"",""Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year"",""world"",""A.C.

"74497",":Article","  Zinedine Yazid Zidane (French: Zinédine Yazid Zidane;[4] Kabyle: Zineddin Lyazid Zidan; born 23 June 1972), popularly known as Zizou, is a French professional football manager and former player who played as an attacking midfielder. He most recently coached Spanish club Real Madrid and is one of the most successful coaches in the world. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Zidane was a playmaker renowned for his elegance, vision, passing, ball control, and technique. He received many individual accolades as a player, including being named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003, and winning the 1998 Ballon d'Or. Zidane started his career at Cannes, before establishing himself as one of the best players in the French Ligue 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he moved to Italian team Juventus, where he won several trophies, including two Serie A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the time of €77.5 million in 2001, which remained unmatched for the next eight years. In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 Champions League final, he scored a left-foot volleyed winner that is considered one of the greatest goals in the competition's history. Capped 108 times by France, Zidane won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a brace in the final, and was named to the All-Star team. This triumph made him a national hero in France and he received the Legion of Honour in 1998. He won UEFA Euro 2000 and was named Player of the Tournament. He also received the Golden Ball as Player of the Tournament at the 2006 World Cup, despite his infamous sending off in the final against Italy for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest. He retired as the fourth-most capped player in French history. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world's greatest living players compiled by Pelé, and in the same year was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. Zidane is one of nine players to have won the World Cup, the Champions League, and the Ballon d'Or. He was the ambassador for Qatar's successful bid to stage the 2022 World Cup, the first Arab country to host the tournament. After retiring as a player, Zidane began his coaching career at Real Madrid Castilla. He remained in the position for two years, before taking the helm of the first team in 2016. In his initial two and a half seasons, Zidane became the first coach to win the Champions League three times in a row, won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup twice each, as well as a La Liga title and a Supercopa de España. This success led to Zidane being named Best FIFA Men's Coach in 2017. He resigned in 2018, but returned to the club in 2019, and won another La Liga and a Supercopa de España title, before leaving again in 2021. Zinedine Yazid Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille, in Southern France.[5] He is the youngest of five siblings.[6] Zidane is of Algerian Kabyle descent and has described himself as a ""non-practising Muslim"".[7][8] His parents, Smaïl and Malika, immigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War. The family, which had settled in the city's tough northern districts of Barbès and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille.[9] In an interview with Esquire magazine, he stated: I have an affinity with the Arabic world. I have it in my blood, via my parents. I'm very proud of being French, but also very proud of having these roots and this diversity.[10] His father worked as a warehouseman and security guard at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife.[7] The family lived a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighbourhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates.[8][11] Zidane credits his strict upbringing and his father as the ""guiding light"" in his career.[10] It was in Castellane where Zidane had his earliest introduction in football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood's children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex.[12] In July 2011, Zidane named former Marseille players Blaž Slišković, Enzo Francescoli and Jean-Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up.[13][14] At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player's licence after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri.[15] After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO Septèmes-les-Vallons when the Septèmes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club's Director to get Zidane.[15] Zidane stayed with Septèmes until the age of 14, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the CREPS (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in Aix-en-Provence, one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation. It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout and former player Jean Varraud, who recommended him to the training centre director of the club.[16] As a 14-year-old watching the 1986 World Cup, the performance of Diego Maradona left an indelible mark on him, with Zidane stating Maradona ""was on another level"".[17] ""He'd go past one, two, three, five, six players – it was sublime. His feet spoke with the ball"" —Jean Varraud, former player who discovered Zidane.[16] Zidane went to Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes Director Jean-Claude Elineau to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that, while living with the Elineaus, he found equilibrium.[7] It was at Cannes where Zidane's first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive, prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family.[7] His first coach, Jean Varraud, encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game. Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins.[7] The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being an Algerian-Frenchman suspended between cultures, and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up.[7] Zidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 in a French Division 1 match against Nantes.[18] He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991[19] also against Nantes in a 2–1 win. After the match, during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was given a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club.[20] On the pitch, Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball, offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game.[16] In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after finishing fourth in the league. This remains the club's highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948–49 season.[21] Zidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992–93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruher SC[22][23] and finishing runner-up against Bayern Munich in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup[23][24][25] during his four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, ""Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?""[26] Also toward the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for £1.2 million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division.[27] In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year.[28] ""He is a special player. He creates space where there is none. No matter where he gets the ball or how it comes to him, he can get out of trouble. His imagination and his technique are amazing"" —Juventus teammate Edgar Davids on Zidane's ability.[29] After a series of stand out performances for both Bordeaux and France, Zidane had offers to join Europe's top clubs in the spring of 1996, deciding on a move to UEFA Champions League winners Juventus during the close season.[30] Zidane's impact in Italy was immediate, winning the 1996–97 Serie A title and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup.[31] He was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year in his first season.[32] Zidane's growing status in the sport saw him chosen in a European XI to face a World XI – featuring a forward line of Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta – in December 1997.[33] As the playmaker at Juve, Zidane played just behind forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Del Piero recalling, ""Zidane had an extraordinary talent, which contributed to his sole interest in helping the team. He was not a selfish player. He had a unique ability to be a great and to be a team player. I was lucky to play with him.""[34] He lost in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final 3–1 to Borussia Dortmund when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of Paul Lambert.[35] The following season, Zidane scored seven goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the 1997–98 Serie A and thus retain the Scudetto. In Europe, Juventus made their third consecutive UEFA Champions League Final appearance, but lost the game 1–0 to Real Madrid. In 1998, Zidane was named FIFA World Player of the Year, and won the Ballon d'Or. Juventus finished second in the 2000–01 Serie A, but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, after Zidane was banned for head-butting Hamburger SV player Jochen Kientz.[36] In 2001, Zidane was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second time.[32] In 2001, Zidane joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of 150 billion Italian lire,[37][38] (about €77.5 million by fixed exchange rate; a reported 12.8 billion pesetas[39]) in instalments,[40] and signed a four-year contract. The latest addition to the Galácticos era of global stars signed by Real Madrid every year, in his first season at the club Zidane scored a famous match-winning goal, a volley hit with his weaker left foot from the edge of the 18-yard box, in Madrid's 2–1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final.[41][42] The goal has been cited as one of the greatest in Champions League history.[41][43][44] The magnitude of the strike saw Zidane produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran toward the touchline with mouth wide open, screaming in delight.[45] Zinedine Zidane, 18 yards out, watching and waiting, adjusts his body and, in one, smooth movement, pirouettes and catches it full on the volley with his left foot. It flies past Hans-Jörg Butt. It was the moment of Zidane's apotheosis, more so than the 1998 World Cup final, because of the moment's grace and beauty, because of his control of everything around him. He was Bruce Lee in slow motion while kung-fu chaos reigned around. ""He dominates the ball, he is a walking spectacle and he plays as if he had silk gloves on each foot. He makes it worthwhile going to the stadium – he's one of the best I have ever seen."" —Alfredo Di Stéfano on Zidane after he was named World Player of the Year in 2003.[46] The next season, Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the 2002–03 La Liga, starring alongside Luís Figo in midfield, and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year for the third time.[47] In 2004, fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in UEFA's fiftieth-anniversary Golden Jubilee Poll.[48] While Zidane's final season of club football ended without a trophy, he enjoyed success on a personal note by scoring his first hat-trick, against Sevilla, in a 4–2 win in January 2006.[49] He ended the season for Real Madrid as their second highest goalscorer and assists provider behind teammates Ronaldo and David Beckham respectively, with nine goals and ten assists in 28 games.[50] On 7 May 2006, Zidane, who had announced his plans to retire after the 2006 World Cup,[51] played his farewell match and scored in a 3–3 draw with Villarreal. The squad wore commemorative shirts with ZIDANE 2001–2006 below the club logo. The 80,000 fans inside the Santiago Bernabéu held up a banner reading, ""Thanks for the magic.""[16] In 2012, Zidane featured for Madrid in an All Stars Match against Manchester United which resulted in a 3–2 win for Real. In April 2013, he was named by Marca as a member of the ""Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid's history.""[52] Both France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen. It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough.[53] Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.[54] Zidane was a member of the French under-21 squad that won a bronze medal at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon.[55] He earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2–2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2–0 deficit. After Eric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position.[56] Despite not being at his best during the tournament, France reached the last four. Zidane was not yet fully established in the French team and his level was quite average during the whole event, but he managed to score in the penalty shootout in both the quarter-final and semi-final. France was eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout against the Czech Republic.[57] The 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in; the tournament was held in his home country, France. The French team won all three games in the group stage, with Zidane setting up Christophe Dugarry's goal in the opening match against South Africa from a corner, and contributing to Thierry Henry's opening goal in the second match against Saudi Arabia. He was sent off in the latter match for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup Finals match.[59] Without their playmaker, France proceeded to win 1–0 in the round of sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy 4–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter-finals, with Zidane netting the first spot kick in the shoot-out.[60] France then defeated Croatia 2–1 in the semi-final. Although Zidane had played a role in the team's accomplishments, he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.[59][61] Zidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two similar goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff. Courtesy of Zidane's two goals, France went into the half-time break 2–0 up with one hand on the World Cup trophy.[16] Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3–0 win and France's first World Cup. Named man of the match, Zidane became an instant national hero and would receive the Legion of Honour later that year.[58] More than one million people lined the Champs-Élysées in Paris, with celebrations centred around the Arc de Triomphe.[62][63] Two years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a bending free kick against Spain in the quarter-final and the golden goal in the semi-final against Portugal with a penalty.[64][65] UEFA named Zidane Player of the Tournament.[66] Zidane himself believes he was at his peak during the tournament, while the UEFA website states, ""In Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane dominated a major championship in a way no individual had managed since Diego Maradona in 1986. From the opening game against Denmark to the final against Italy, 'Zizou' shone brightly, casting a spell on his opponents with clever flicks, mesmerising stepovers, slaloming runs and masterful vision.""[67] As reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup in Japan/Korea as favourites but a thigh injury sustained in a warm up match before the tournament prevented Zidane from playing in France's first two matches and without their talisman, the French team failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.[68] At Euro 2004, France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland, before being knocked out in the quarter finals by eventual champions Greece in a surprise 1–0 loss.[69] In the opening match against England, Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn impending defeat into a 2–1 victory.[70][71] After France's elimination, Zidane announced his retirement from international football.[72] What I am going to say may sound over the top, but it's the truth. God exists and he has returned to the France team. Thierry Henry, on Zidane's return.[73] With the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude Makélélé and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. At the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain.[74] Zidane, along with Thuram and Makélélé, made his competitive return for France in a 3–0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 September 2005. The trio helped France rise from fourth place to win their qualifying group.[75] On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1–0 friendly win over Mexico, in what would also be his last match at the Stade de France. Zidane became France's fourth player to reach 100 caps, after Desailly, Thuram and Didier Deschamps.[76] France had a slow start to the 2006 Finals and, after being suspended for the third match of the group stage, Zidane returned to set up a goal for Patrick Vieira and score one himself in the second round match against Spain.[77] In the quarter-final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted Thierry Henry's deciding goal and was named Man of the Match by FIFA.[78][79] France faced Portugal in the semi-final and, as in Brussels six years earlier, Zidane's penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.[80][81] Having already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005–06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane's second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, Zidane put France ahead with a Panenka-style penalty kick which struck the crossbar and bounced just over the goal line[82] to become only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with Pelé, Paul Breitner, and Vavá, in addition to being tied for first place with Vavá, Pelé and Geoff Hurst with three World Cup final goals apiece. He almost scored a second goal during the first period of extra time but his header was saved by Italy's goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Zidane was then sent off in the 110th minute of the game after headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest,[83][84] so he did not participate in the penalty shootout, which Italy won 5–3.[85] This marked the 14th overall expulsion of Zidane's career, and joined him with Cameroon's Rigobert Song as the only players ever to be sent off during two separate World Cup tournaments.[86] Something curious about Zidane's expulsion was that the referee didn't even see the headbutting, so he went to ask the linesmen, who didn't see anything either. But the fourth referee did see the play, and convinced of his expression, he sent off the 10th of the French team. He also became the fourth player red-carded in a World Cup final, in addition to being the first sent off in extra time.[87] Zidane's actions made headlines all over the world, while in France Le Figaro called his head-butt ""odious"", and the front page of L'Équipe asked, ""What should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?""[81] Zidane had received plaudits for his performances during the tournament, with Pep Guardiola writing he exerts so much influence on the team that ""France are never disorganised"".[88] The day after the final, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament.[89] ""The match you played last night was full of talent and professionalism. I know that you are sad and disappointed but what I want to tell you is that the whole country is extremely proud of you. You have honoured the country with your exceptional qualities and your fantastic fighting spirit, which was your strength in difficult times, but also in winning times."" —President of France, Jacques Chirac, pays tribute to Zidane in Paris after the 2006 World Cup.[81] Upon his return to France, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting ""Zizou! Zizou!"", and tributes were led by the French president Jacques Chirac.[81] Chirac's words reflected the feeling of the French public, with polls done in the immediate wake of the incident showing support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them.[81] According to French journalist Philippe Auclair, Zidane's performances in the knock-out rounds were ""ranked among his finest in a blue shirt.""[81] As the player of the tournament, Zidane had given the team hope, with the French daily newspaper Libération stating, ""For a month, France was dreaming with Zidane.""[81] Zidane remained an icon to the French public, and one French writer stated, ""It's good for us to see our national hero is fallible.""[81] It was later revealed through interviews that Marco Materazzi had insulted Zidane's sister, which led to Zidane's heightened anger and reaction.[90] In 2010, Zidane said that he would ""rather die than apologize"" to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final,[91] but also admitted that he ""could never have lived with himself"" had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match.[92] He later said, ""If you look at the fourteen red cards I had in my career, twelve of them were a result of provocation. This isn't justification, this isn't an excuse, but my passion, temper and blood made me react.""[93] Following his red card in the final, Zidane retired from professional football and confirmed that he would not go back on his decision.[94] He was sentenced by FIFA to a three-match suspension for the red card.[95] As he already retired, he agreed to complete three days of community service with children in one of FIFA's humanitarian projects.[96] Zidane ended up tying with Brazil's Cafu for the record for most cards given in World Cup matches, with six.[97] Since his retirement, Zidane has regularly played for the Real Madrid Veterans team. He has also made several futsal appearances. In 2015 he played in a futsal tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during which an opposition player received a yellow card to much amusement for taking an in-match selfie with Zidane.[98] In an interview in June 2008, Zidane stated that he wanted to return to football, but that he had no immediate plans to do so.[99] On 1 June 2009, Zidane was announced as the advisor to the president after Florentino Pérez was named president of Real Madrid for the second time.[100] He, along with general director Jorge Valdano and sporting director Miguel Pardeza, were to be the key decisionmakers on the sporting side of the club.[100] After France's dismal campaign in the 2010 World Cup, Zidane said that he did not plan to move into coaching any time soon.[101] Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid committee announced in September 2010 that Zidane had been appointed as an ambassador for Qatar's attempt to host the 2022 World Cup.[102] After FIFA announced on 2 December 2010 that Qatar had won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup,[103] Zidane stated that he was ""very pleased"" with the outcome.[104] Zidane spoke of the message he was trying to convey in the campaign: ""I was saying that football belonged to the whole world. I'm proud to have made my contribution to a new country getting the World Cup. Qatar and the entire Middle East as a whole deserves this event and that makes me happy. It's a victory for the Arab world.""[105] Zidane has supported two Olympic bids for Paris, including the 2012 Summer Olympics which was narrowly won by London and later Paris' successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Paris will also be hosting the 2024 Summer Paralympics.[106] On 24 February 2007, before a crowd of 10,000 fans at a match in northern Thailand for the Keuydaroon children's AIDS charity, Zidane scored the first goal and set up the second for a Malaysian teammate as the match ended 2–2. The event raised ฿260,000 ($7,750). This money paid for the building of two schools and 16 three-bedroom houses.[107] On 19 November 2008, Zidane took part in the fifth annual Match Against Poverty in Málaga, Spain, which also ended in a 2–2 draw; he went scoreless but set up his team's second goal. He and Ronaldo, who collaborated in conceiving the yearly event to benefit the United Nations Development Programme, regularly captain their respective teams consisting of active footballers, other professional athletes and celebrities.[108] Zidane, a UN Goodwill Ambassador since 2001, stated before the game that ""everyone can do something to make the world a better place.""[109] In June and July 2009, Zidane toured across Canada with stops in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Although billed as Zidane and ""Friends"", the likes of which included Fabien Barthez and Samuel Eto'o, the exhibition matches featured local players. Some proceeds were given to UNICEF.[110] On 6 June 2010, Zidane took part in the biennial charity event Soccer Aid. He played for the Rest of the World team, managed by former Liverpool and Celtic forward Kenny Dalglish against England alongside former Real Madrid teammate Luís Figo and Celtic legend Henrik Larsson. He played against former players such as Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer, as well as celebrities such as Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers, Michael Sheen, chef Gordon Ramsay, actor Damian Lewis and singer Robbie Williams.[111] The match took place at Old Trafford, Manchester and was won by the Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by Harrelson after a 2–2 draw.[111] On 2 June 2013, Zidane took part in a charity match played at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United Legends vs. Real Madrid Legends reverse fixture. The first leg took place in Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Part of a team that included the likes of Figo, Fernando Redondo and Manolo Sanchís, the fixture raised funds for the Manchester United Foundation.[112] The 12th Match against Poverty took place in Saint-Étienne, France, on Monday 20 April 2015, where Ronaldo and Zidane teamed up with other football stars against past and present players of French Ligue 1 club AS Saint-Étienne. According to UNDP, ""two-thirds of all proceeds will go toward helping the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone build back better from the Ebola epidemic.""[113] In June 2018, Zidane reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star side which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. In a 3–2 win for France, Thierry Henry played a no-look one-two pass with Zidane before scoring, with Zidane then curling in a 25-yard free kick.[114] In November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid's first team in response to an appeal made by then-Real Madrid coach José Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach.[115] In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid's new sporting director.[116] In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.[117] In June 2014, Real Madrid announced that Zidane would be the coach of Real Madrid's B team, Real Madrid Castilla.[118] On 29 August, the director of the Spanish National Football Coach Education Centre (CENAFE), Miguel Galán, reported Zidane for acting as Real Madrid Castilla's head coach without the necessary coaching badges.[119] According to Galán, ""No one who has anything to do with the football world can be unaware that Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla's head coach this season. It is a fait accompli that has been widely accepted, as shown by media reports, and Real Madrid do not deny it.""[119] While the official match report for Castilla's opening game in the Segunda División B lists Santiago Sánchez as the Los Blancos' head coach and Zidane as his assistant, Galán states, ""This hierarchy only exists on paper. The truth is the exact opposite: Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla's head coach, while, with all due respect to him as a colleague, Mr Sánchez's role basically boils down to providing the badges.""[119][120] On 4 January 2016, Real Madrid announced the dismissal of Rafael Benítez and on the same day Zidane was appointed the new head coach of the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal.[121] His first match as the club's new manager took place five days later, when Real Madrid beat Deportivo La Coruña 5–0 in a La Liga match. In his first El Clásico as a coach, held on 2 April at the Camp Nou, Zidane led his club to a 2–1 win over Barcelona, ending Barça's 39-match unbeaten run.[122] On 4 May, Zidane led Real Madrid to a place in the Champions League final by beating Manchester City 1–0 on aggregate.[123] In La Liga, Madrid ended up finishing second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona.[124] On 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won after a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over Atlético Madrid, with the achievement being termed ""La Undécima"".[125][126] Zidane became the seventh man to win the European Cup both as a player and a coach and the second man (after Miguel Muñoz) to achieve the feat with Real Madrid. He also became the first French coach, except the French-Argentinian Helenio Herrera, to win the trophy.[127][128] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[129] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[130] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[131] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[132] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[133] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. In May of that year, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[134] On 3 June 2017, the club's Champions League final win against Juventus resulted in Real Madrid being the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[135][136] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as ""La Duodécima"".[137] With Real's Champions League victory, Zidane became only the second manager to win the European Cup in his first two seasons in management, alongside fellow Real Madrid coach José Villalonga.[138] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[139] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[140] This title tied Zidane with Vicente del Bosque as the third most successful Real Madrid coach with seven titles, one short of Luis Molowny. This also meant that, at the time, Zidane had won as many titles in his coaching position in Real Madrid as games lost during his tenure. Zidane's success saw him named Best FIFA Men's Coach in 2017.[141] On 16 December 2017, Zidane won his eighth trophy as coach as Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[142] On 24 January 2018, Madrid was knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage by Leganés on away goals. The team's league campaign was also a disappointment as Real collected only 76 points and finished third, 17 points behind champions Barcelona. Madrid fared far better in the Champions League, once again progressing to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. At that time, he became one of three managers, alongside Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti, to win the European Cup three times, while also becoming the first coach to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons.[143] On 31 May, five days after the Champions League final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid coach, citing the club's ""need for change"" as his rationale for departing.[144][145] Following some poor results for Real Madrid in the months following Zidane's departure – culminating in elimination from the Copa del Rey at home to Barcelona, a league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4–1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week – his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui's equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane returned as the Real Madrid head coach on 11 March 2019, on a contract until summer 2022.[146][147] The 2019–20 season seemed a promising one, as Madrid went on a spending spree in the summer of 2019, signing Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million. On 12 January 2020, Zidane guided Madrid to their first trophy in his second spell, with the club defeating cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final.[148] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[149] It was Zidane's second league title in his coaching career.[150] His collective mindset was hailed by international and Spanish media, as Real Madrid broke several records, including the number of scorers and maintaining their best league defensive record in 30 years, with 21 of his players managing to get on the scoresheet during the campaign.[151][152][153] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season.[154] He was approached to become coach of the United States after the end of the 2022 FIFA World Cup on early 2023, which he declined.[155] ""Zidane is the master. Over the past ten years, there's been no one like him, he has been the best player in the world."" —Pelé[156] ""Technically, I think he is the king of what's fundamental in the game – control and passing. I don't think anyone can match him when it comes to controlling or receiving the ball."" —Michel Platini[157] Many authoritative voices have acclaimed Zidane's skills and importance in the history of football, such as Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who called Zidane ""a monster"" for his performance and abilities.[158] German coach Franz Beckenbauer stated, ""Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player.""[158] Italy manager Marcello Lippi, who also coached Zidane, opined, ""I think Zidane is the greatest talent we've known in football these last twenty years.""[158] Former England manager Kevin Keegan said, ""You look at Zidane and think 'I've never seen a player quite like that.' What sets Zidane apart is the way he manipulates a football, buying himself space that isn't there. Add his vision and it makes him very special.""[159] At the 1998 World Cup, Italian manager Cesare Maldini said, ""I would give up five players to have Zidane in my squad.""[160] In terms of ball retention he was probably the greatest player of all time, blessed with such grace and supernatural awareness that he could play a game of real-life Pac-Man and never be caught. Among his playing peers, Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimović commented, ""Zidane was from another planet. When Zidane stepped onto the pitch, the ten other guys just got suddenly better. It is that simple.""[162] David Beckham has described Zidane as ""the greatest of all time"",[163][164] Barcelona star Xavi has stated in a 2010 interview that Zidane was ""best player in the '90s and early 2000s"",[165] while Brazilian defender and former Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos has said of Zidane, ""He is the best player I've seen. Supporters arrived earlier at the Bernabéu just to see him warm-up.""[166] Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho stated, ""Zidane is one of the best footballers of all time, one of my idols. He had such elegance and grace, a wonderful touch and superb vision.""[167] Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard regards Zidane as ""the best ever"", and growing up he learned from his idol by ""watching him on television and online for hours.""[168][169] Displaying skills with an array of moves such as his signature La Roulette pirouette, step overs and close ball control, former Brazilian international Rivaldo stated, ""His elegance of movement on the pitch and his skills are uncanny.""[170] Journalist Sid Lowe wrote, ""Zidane was football's answer to the Bolshoi Ballet. Zidane was elegance above all else.""[171] In 2005, upon Zidane's return to the French national team, his teammate Thierry Henry stated, ""In France, everybody realized that God exists, and that he is back in the French international team.""[172] Zidane has been lauded by sportsmen outside football; having witnessed Zidane's goal against Deportivo La Coruña in January 2002, where he dragged the ball right then left, turning the defender inside out, before scoring with a left foot finish, basketball player Magic Johnson stated, ""One of the most inspiring nights of my life. Zidane is a phenomenon.""[173] Labelled a ""flawed genius"" by ESPN, Zidane possessed an exceptional first touch, and was also known for his dribbling skills, use of feints, elegance on the ball, and creativity.[174][175][176] He was capable of using either foot, despite being naturally right-footed.[177][178] His technique and co-ordination enabled him to execute shots and volleys with extreme power and precision, in particular from outside the penalty area;[157][179] he was also a free kick and penalty kick specialist.[180][181] A world-class offensive playmaker, Zidane's natural position was in a free role as a classic number 10 behind the strikers.[174][182][183] He was also capable of playing as a second striker,[184][185] or in a more withdrawn role in midfield, either as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, due to his ability to orchestrate his team's attacking plays from deep with his vision and passing.[157][159][186][187] Thus, he was capable of both assisting and scoring goals, despite being neither the most prolific goalscorer nor the most productive creator throughout his career.[188] While not known for his heading ability, his height and physical strength also allowed him to be effective in the air, and saw him score several crucial headers throughout his career.[189] He also drew praise from his managers for his defensive work-rate.[175][190] Despite not being the quickest player, he possessed good agility and acceleration,[175][187][190] as well as exceptional balance and flair on the ball.[7][191] He also had excellent positional sense[189] and outstanding spatial awareness.[192] Although he had a reserved and humble character, his former Juventus managers Lippi and Ancelotti also praised Zidane for being a team player, on whom his teammates could rely.[182] Notwithstanding the acclaim that Zidane received from pundits over his playing ability, he also drew criticism in the media over his temperament and discipline, and for his occasional violent conduct on the pitch, which led to instances in which disciplinary action was taken against him; he was also accused by some in the sport of drifting in and out of games, and of lacking leadership qualities, although he was able to establish himself as a consistent and decisive player, who was also an influential captain at international level throughout his career.[7][193] Zidane has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times, a feat achieved only by Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[194] In 2002, ESPN described Zidane as ""the greatest player in the world in the world's biggest game"".[173] In a 2002 FIFA poll, Zidane was selected in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team.[195] In 2004, he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years, and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[196] In a 2004 poll conducted by French newspaper Journal du Dimanche, Zidane was voted as ""the most popular Frenchman of all time"".[7] In 2014, in a poll carried out by French TV channel TF1, Zidane was voted as the best player in the history of the French league.[197] In 2016, in a study led by French newspaper Le Parisien, Zidane was named ""best French player of all time"".[198] Despite establishing himself as one of the most successful coaches of his era and in the history of Real Madrid,[A] Zidane's time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck.[B] His tactical philosophy, particularly its flexibility, has been praised by many.[199][200][201][202] Zidane's tactical style, characterized by its formation flexibility and attacking football, as well as his ability to unite the dressing room, have been positively compared to Carlo Ancelotti's coaching method.[203][204][205] His use of in-game substitutions was particularly praised, as many of his substitutes led to victories, such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1–0 deficit into a 3–1 victory. Similarly, his use of Gareth Bale as a substitute in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final proved crucial; Bale scored two goals after being brought on, turning a 1-1 tie into a 3-1 Madrid victory. It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks,[206] while he is credited for repopularising the 4–4–2 diamond formation in contemporary football.[207] On the other hand, some consider that Zidane's role was more focused in grinding out results and uniting the dressing room, rather than having a fixed tactical scheme.[208][209] Zidane emphasised the importance of players' physical levels and preferred to choose impactful players over a defined system.[210] During his time at Real Madrid, he used several formations, including the 4–3–3, the 4–2–3–1, the 4–4–2, and the 3–5–2,[211] in order to find the system that best suited his players, and has been credited with using ""simple systems"", ""...so that his players have the freedom needed to prove their superiority.""[212] As such, although he is not considered to be a tactical innovator, he has been praised for his balanced approach as a coach, and for having the leadership skills and personability to manage and motivate several world class players, create a good team environment, foster professional relationships, and a strong winning mentality; he has also demonstrated an ability to rotate players and get the best out his team, which has played a key role in his success. In 2019 he commented ""You ask me about two players but what interests me is the group. Karim is important for the team, not just for his goals. Casemiro gives a lot of balance, but not only that. Everyone contributes something to the team in their own way on the field"".[213] Regarding his coaching role at Real Madrid, Zidane commented in 2018: ""When you work with high-quality players, they know how to manage those periods of games when you’re not playing well, and they get things back on track very quickly. My job was to keep people calm!""[214] Two of his main influences as a manager are his own former managers Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti.[203][215] Zidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior. These sponsorship deals earned him €8.6 million on top of his €6.4 million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling €15 million ($20.4 million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer.[216][217] In 2004, Forbes magazine listed his earnings of $15.8 million for the previous 12 months.[218] In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with Pelé and Diego Maradona.[219] Zidane features as the cover star of the Ultimate Edition of the FIFA video game FIFA 20.[220] In 2005, filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras. Scottish post-rock band Mogwai provided the soundtrack. The documentary was part of the 2009 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.[221] In November 2006, Zidane toured Bangladesh as the guest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus.[222] He also visited the Algerian birthplace of his parents and met with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who gave him an official reception.[223] In 2012, Algerian artist Adel Abdessemed unveiled a bronze sculpture depicting Zidane's headbutt of Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup Final.[224] On 5 November 2006, Zidane appeared in the American animated sitcom Family Guy, seen headbutting an old lady in the episode ""Saving Private Brian"" as a parody of his headbutt on Materazzi.[225] The infamous headbutt has also been the subject of a lyrical essay by the Belgian novelist Jean-Philippe Toussaint entitled La Mélancolie de Zidane (2006).[226] In 2010, footage of Zidane appeared in the ""Waka Waka"" music video by Shakira, which shows him celebrating France winning the 1998 World Cup.[227] In 2014, Australian sports presenter Les Murray collaborated with the band Vaudeville Smash and performed a Zidane tribute song, the accompanying video featuring four footballers performing ball tricks in Zidane masks, one of whom ends up headbutting a nightwatchman.[228][229] In 2016, Zidane was ranked one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre of Jordan, which noted: ""[Zidane's] modest character has endeared him to the wider public.""[230] At the age of 17, Zidane met his future wife, Véronique Fernandez (born in Aveyron of Spanish descent),[232] while playing for Cannes in the 1988–89 season. Married in 1994, they have four sons: Enzo Zidane (born 24 March 1995),[233] Luca Zidane (born 13 May 1998),[234] Théo Zidane (born 18 May 2002),[235] and Elyaz Zidane (born 26 December 2005).[236] On 12 July 2019, his elder brother Farid died of cancer at the age of 54.[237][238]  Bordeaux[16] Juventus[16] Real Madrid[16] France U16 France[16] Individual Real Madrid Individual ","Zinedine

"74498",":Article","  Fahid Ben Khalfallah (Arabic: فهيد بن خلف الله; born 9 October 1982) is a retired professional footballer who played as a winger or attacking midfielder. Born in France, he played for the Tunisia national team between 2008 and 2011. In the summer of 2009, he signed for Valenciennes FC for three years. He started the season very well, starting five games and coming on as a substitute in another five, scoring three goals and providing five assists. In August 2010, Ben Khalfallah joined Bordeaux signing a four-year contract with a fee of €5 million being paid to Valenciennes.[5][6] He joined Troyes in January 2014.[7] In September 2014 he signed a one-year contract with Melbourne Victory.[8] His first season in Australia was very successful; scoring five goals and making nine assists in the A-League helping to win that competitions Premiership and Championship, as well as being awarded the Victory Medal as the club's player of the season.[9] On 24 April 2015, Melbourne Victory announced that they had retained Ben Khalfallah's services for a further two years, the player citing that he enjoyed life in Melbourne and playing for the club.[10] On 26 April 2017, Ben Khalfallah confirmed that he would be leaving the Victory at the end of the season.[11][12][13] This was confirmed by the club on 12 May 2017, with Ben Khalfallah listed as one of seven players departing the club at the end of the season.[14] Ben Khalfallah signed with rival A-League club Brisbane Roar on a one-season deal shortly after leaving the Victory.[15] On 20 April 2018, following the elimination of Brisbane Roar against Melbourne City in the A-League Elimination Finals, Fahid Ben Khalfallah decided to retire at the age of 35.[16] On 19 May 2018, only a month after announcing his retirement, Ben Khalfallah came out of retirement and sign for NPL2 East Victoria club Nunawading City for the remainder of the season. After promising the coaching staff he would play for Nunawading after his stint with Roar, Ben Khalfallah made his debut on the same day his signing was announced against the Eastern Lions in a goalless draw.[17] Ben Khalfallah scored his first goal for Nunawading against Melbourne City FC Youth, winning the game 3–1. Nunawading finished the season in bottom place in NPL2 East and were relegated to the fifth-tier State League Division 1 South-East for 2019. In September 2018, Ben Khalfallah was announced as player-coach of Nunawading for the 2019 State League 1 season. Nunawading went on to finish top of the 2019 State League 1 South East ladder, winning the league and winning promotion back into the NPL in 2020.[18] On 15 October 2021, after two disrupted seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Nunawading City announced on their Facebook page that they had parted ways with Ben Khalfallah and assistant Devon Bonne after the 2021 NPL3 Season had been cancelled. Ben Khalfallah was born in Peronne, France, to Tunisian parents. His father had emigrated to France, also as a professional footballer. Although his parents were Muslim, Ben Khalfallah has described himself as an atheist.[19] He has often spoken very positively of the experience for himself and his family since moving to Melbourne, Australia, for Melbourne Victory, and this was a key reason for his re-signing for the club.[10] Ben Khalfallah currently works as a player agent.[20] Bordeaux Melbourne Victory: Nunawading City Individual","Fahid Ben Khalfallah","[""Fahid Ben Khalfallah"",""midfielder"",""winger"",""season"",""Nunawading City"",""goals"",""Arabic"",""player"",""games"",""team"",""substitute"",""experience"",""Victory"",""Brisbane Roar"",""retirement"",""France"",""season"",""Valenciennes FC"",""Tunisia"",""assists"",""Australia"",""goals"",""Bordeaux"",""page"",""contract"",""contract"",""season"",""club"",""club"",""Devon Bonne"",""club"",""Melbourne"",""helping"",""competitions"",""fee"",""players"",""Melbourne Victory."",""assists"",""one"",""seasons"",""services"",""elimination"",""A-League"",""retirement"",""deal"",""Valenciennes."",""life"",""remainder"",""age"",""debut"",""coaching staff"",""stint"",""signing"",""club."",""league"",""NPL2 East Victoria"",""Melbourne City"",""parents"",""Troyes"",""Victory Medal"",""NPL3 Season"",""ladder"",""ways"",""pandemic"",""father"",""player"",""Roar"",""promotion"",""A-League Elimination Finals"",""Championship"",""Premiership"",""State League 1 South East"",""footballer"",""Eastern Lions"",""season"",""season"",""family"",""re-signing"",""NPL"",""COVID"",""Facebook"",""Peronne"",""Tunisian"",""goal"",""player-coach"",""game"",""place"",""top"",""Muslim"",""State League Division 1 South-East"",""NPL2 East"",""parents"",""State League 1"",""Melbourne City FC Youth"",""1"",""19"",""2011"",""2009"",""August 2010"",""January 2014"",""September 2014"",""24 April 2015"",""26 April 2017"",""12 May 2017"",""20 April 2018"",""19 May 2018"",""2019"",""September 2018"",""2019"",""2019"",""2020"",""15 October 2021"",""2021"",""€5 million"",""5 million"",""five"",""two"",""2015"",""2019"",""three"",""2008"",""2019"",""three"",""2011"",""two"",""2018"",""16"",""2010"",""24"",""5"",""seven"",""nine"",""2018"",""12"",""9 October 1982"",""2017"",""12"",""11"",""1"",""20"",""19"",""9"",""2017"",""one"",""15"",""2014"",""18"",""2009"",""14"",""3"",""2020"",""1982"",""6"",""13"",""1"",""19"",""2014"",""20"",""four"",""2018"",""8"",""35"",""2019"",""one"",""26"",""1"",""7"",""2021"",""one"",""2021"",""15"",""9"",""five"",""10"",""17"",""five"",""10"",""five"",""2008""]","0.004359719282721354","true","[0.7501055,0.017714897,0.012443833,0.010513974,0.010473794,0.0074128895,0.007379159,0.007295915,0.0067637623,0.0059945174,0.0059437826,0.005827977,0.0048774644,0.0046206047,0.0045453086,0.0045244354,0.0045023244,0.0040179756,0.0035476028,0.0032489453,0.003236051,0.0028034532,0.002724512,0.0026846258,0.002557175,0.002557175,0.0024908131,0.0023900156,0.0023900156,0.0023621642,0.0023608082,0.002281427,0.002246292,0.002246292,0.002246292,0.0021799968,0.0021482017,0.0021449218,0.0019149018,0.0018654007,0.0018001935,0.0017465774,0.001707405,0.0015988711,0.0015341262,0.0015117403,0.0014785309,0.0014043675,0.0014043675,0.0014017062,0.0014017062,0.0014017062,0.0014017062,0.0013955678,0.0013586883,0.0013430045,0.0012886106,0.001195807,0.0011176731,0.0011176731,0.0011025431,0.0010515302,0.0010515302,0.0010515302,0.0010491732,0.0010425292,0.0010340965,0.0010134102,9.066503E-4,8.9555816E-4,8.9555816E-4,8.8319555E-4,8.3593704E-4,8.283576E-4,8.2012883E-4,8.189405E-4,7.3346996E-4,7.3346996E-4,6.213487E-4,6.213487E-4,6.213487E-4,6.2062E-4,6.2062E-4,5.77921E-4,5.2544486E-4,5.079586E-4,4.6214822E-4,4.608801E-4,4.3336427E-4,3.8813724E-4,3.8813724E-4,3.705271E-4,3.6559752E-4,2.7348258E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Fahid Ben Khalfallah - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahid_Ben_Khalfallah",,,,,,,
"74499",":Article","  Adriaan ""Adje"" Paulen, RMWO ( Dutch: [ˈaːdriaːn ˈɑcə ˈpʌulə(n)]; 12 October 1902 – 9 May 1985) was a Dutch athlete who competed from 1917 to 1931. During World War II, he was part of the Dutch resistance in the Netherlands. Following World War II, Paulen became a sports official, becoming president of the IAAF (then International Amateur Athletic Federation), serving from 1976 to 1981.[1] Competing in three Summer Olympics, Paulen earned his best finish of seventh in the 800 m event at Antwerp in 1920.[2][3] In 1924,[4] he became first of over forty world record breakers (up to his 1985 death) in athletics at Bislett stadion in Oslo, setting a record in 500 m, then an official distance.[5] Besides competing at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Paulen was also a member of the Organizing Committee.[5] Stepping down from his athletic career in 1931, Paulen also participated in the Monte Carlo Rally eight times and once competed in the Dutch TT MotoGP event.[5] In his youth, Paulen competed in football at an international level.[5] When Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, Paulen joined the Nederlandsche Unie, an organisation that strived for co-operation with the German occupier. In August 1940 Paulen participated in fusion talks between the Nederlandse Unie and the fascistic Nationaal Front, which original name was Zwart Front (Black Front). Other participants for the Nederlandse Unie during these talks were Jan de Quay, after the war minister-president, Louis Einthoven, former head of the Rotterdam police and afterwar director of the BVD (secret service) and Hans Linthorst Homan, commissioner of the Queen in the province Groningen. For the Nationaal Front the infamous fascist Leader Arnold Meijer was head of a four men delegation. During these talks Jan de Quay, head of the delegation of the Nederlandse Unie, called himself a fascist, the Nederlandse Unie a fascistic organisation and said that he opposed democracy. The fusion talks failed.[6] Later during the war Paulen was engineer at a coal mining industry, the Dutch State Mines. Workers started a strike and Paulen refused to give the Germans a list of strikers and was convicted to death, however Paulen was released soon. In 1944 Paulen crossed the front and joined the allied troops.[5] Paulen met some of the British Army forces during Operation Market Garden in September 1944.[7] Paulen kept a diary regarding Operation Market Garden and its aftermath that was released to the public in 1989, four years after his 1985 death, including meeting with United States Army officials during that time[7] and would eventually be made a Colonel in the US Army.[5] On 7 January 1946, by general order number 8, Paulen was awarded the US Medal of Freedom with bronze palm.[8] On 12 September 1947, by Royal Decree, Paulen was knighted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, receiving the fourth class (Knight) of the Military William Order.[8] The Order is the highest and oldest military honour of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, bestowed for ""performing excellent acts of Bravery, Leadership and Loyalty in battle"".[9] The award is comparable to the British Victoria Cross and seldom awarded. Following the end of World War II, Paulen played a key role in rebuilding the IAAF in 1946.[5] He also served as president from the Dutch Athletic Committee (KNAU) from 1946 to 1964.[10] In 1965, Paulen served as director of the Dutch Olympic Committee, a position he held until 1970.[10] While working for the KNAU and Dutch Olympic Committee, he also served as an official for the IAAF. Paulen's best known role as an IAAF official was at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich when he was responsible for the ""Cata-Pole"" controversy in the men's pole vault and the claim by the pole manufacturers that their poles did not contain carbon fiber even though IAAF rules stated no such requirements.[11] This controversy had a negative impact upon competition which the United States would lose the pole vault gold for the first time in the Summer Olympics.[11] Bob Seagren, who won the pole vault gold at Mexico City in 1968, would finish with silver at Munich.[11] At the end of the competition, Seagren thrust the pole into Paulen's lap, stating he ""was returning the unwanted pole back to ...[Paulen].""[11] Paulen succeeded David Burghley as IAAF President in 1976 and served in that position until 1981.[5] During Paulen's tenure, he led the fight to control doping within athletics.[5] Paulen died during an operation on a broken hip in 1985.[5] The FBK Games in Hengelo were named in Paulen's honor from 1988 to 2000.[12]","Adriaan Paulen","[""Adriaan ``Adje'' Paulen"",""IAAF"",""death"",""Dutch"",""Louis Einthoven"",""Arnold Meijer"",""president"",""sports

"74500",":Article","  Jonathan Henry Bond (born 19 May 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. Bond has played internationally for Wales at under-17 and under-19 levels; he has also been called up to the under-21 and senior teams and the England under-21 squad having chosen to change his international allegiance in 2013. Bond came through the academy system at Watford featuring in the youth and reserve teams at Vicarage Road. During the 2010–11 season Bond featured on the substitutes bench for Watford several times as cover for the injured Rene Gilmartin and also spent time on loan at Brackley Town. In August 2011, Bond again joined Brackley Town on loan to receive some playing experience.[3] On his return to Watford, Bond was again sent out on loan to Conference National side Forest Green Rovers on 4 November 2011 for a month.[4] Bond made his Forest Green debut the next day in a 4–1 win against Alfreton Town.[5] In total Bond made four appearances for Forest Green in his loan spell and was recalled a week early by Watford.[6] On his return to Watford, Bond acted as deputy goalkeeper to Scott Loach on the substitutes bench in the Championship and on 2 January 2012 made his first team debut replacing Loach who had been sent off in a 2–0 loss against Portsmouth at Fratton Park.[7] On 23 February 2012, Bond joined League Two side Dagenham & Redbridge on a monthlong loan deal.[8] He then joined Bury on loan until the end of the season[9] and made his debut in the 3–0 defeat at Brentford on 7 April. After starting Watford's FA Cup defeat to Manchester City on 5 January 2013, Bond made his home league debut in a 2–1 win over Derby County on 23 February 2013 after coming on for the injured Manuel Almunia. Bond made his first league start against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 1 March 2013. He then continued to deputise with starts against Sheffield Wednesday on 5 March 2013, Blackpool on 9 March 2013, Barnsley on 16 March 2013 and once more versus Burnley on 29 March 2013 – all in place of the injured Almunia. With Almunia not back to fitness, Bond made his sixth consecutive start on 2 April 2013 against Hull City in a 1–0 win, keeping his first clean sheet in a man of the match performance. Bond deputised in the final league game of the season against Leeds United on 4 May 2013 after Almunia was injured in the warm-up. Bond then suffered a serious injury of his own after a horrible collision with Ikechi Anya and Dominic Poleon which forced him off on a stretcher. On Saturday 4 July 2015, Bond signed for Reading on a three-year deal from Watford for an undisclosed fee.[10] On 26 August 2016, Bond joined Gillingham on loan until 7 January 2017.[11][12] On 26 June 2017 Bond joined Peterborough United on a six-month loan,[13] extending the loan until the end of the season on 3 January 2018.[14] On 16 July 2018, Bond joined newly relegated West Bromwich Albion on a two-year contract as a free agent. Bond served as back-up to first-choice keeper Sam Johnstone as the club lost in the 2018-19 EFL Championship play-offs in the semi-finals to rivals Aston Villa. However, they bounced back the following year to finish as runners-up in the 2019-20 EFL Championship, gaining promotion back to the Premier League. Bond was released from the club after his contract ended on 1 August 2020. Albion re-signed Bond on a one-year deal before the start of the 2020–21 Premier League season.[15] On 14 January 2021, Bond moved to the United States to sign with Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy.[16][17] Bond has made international appearances for Wales at under-17 level, and scored an 88th minute equalising goal[18] in Wales' 2–1 Uefa Under-17 Championship qualifying match against Russia in October 2009. He later progressed to under-19 level,[19] and has been called up to under-21 squads.[20] In 2010, aged 17, Bond was called up to the full Wales squad for two Euro 2012 qualifying matches,[21] although he did not play in the games.[20] In spite of his caps for Wales, the FAW stated on 19 July 2013 that Bond had chosen to transfer to the English national pool[22] and was called into the English under-21 squad in August 2013.[23] He made his debut for the England under-21s on 19 November, replacing Jack Butland at half-time in a 9–0 win against San Marino.[24] Bond attended Berkhamsted School.[39] His mother is an American from Seattle, which allowed him to hold an American passport.[40][41]","Jonathan Bond","[""Jonathan Henry Bond"",""loan"",""LA

"74501",":Article","  Cléverson Gabriel Córdova (born 9 August 1985), commonly known as Cléo, is a former Brazilian professional footballer who played as a striker. He also holds Serbian citizenship.[1] While playing on three different continents, Cléo scored at least once in the major club international competitions, in the Copa Libertadores for Atlético Paranaense, in the UEFA Champions League for Partizan, and in the AFC Champions League for two clubs, Guangzhou Evergrande and Kashiwa Reysol. Born in Guarapuava, Cléo started out with local club Batel, before joining Comercial-PR. He was later spotted by Olivais e Moscavide, which brought him to Portugal in the summer of 2004. Six months later, Cléo returned to Brazil and signed for Atlético Paranaense, playing with them in the 2005 and 2006 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. He also made three appearances in the 2005 Copa Libertadores, scoring once against Paraguayan side Cerro Porteño.[2] Meanwhile, Cléo spent some time on loan at Ferroviária and Figueirense in 2005.[3][4] In the summer of 2006, Cléo returned to Olivais e Moscavide,[5] staying there for the next two seasons. In August 2008, Cléo moved to Serbian club Red Star Belgrade,[6] on a one-year loan with a view to a permanent move. He was given the number 17 shirt. During a turbulent period for the club, Cléo managed to score 12 goals in 24 appearances (league and cup) that season. He eventually left Red Star after the club was not able to pay a transfer fee of €800,000.[7] On 19 June 2009, Cléo signed a four-year contract with Partizan, becoming the first player to join the club from arch-rivals Red Star in more than 20 years (the last was Goran Milojević in 1988).[8] He scored on his official debut for Partizan on 14 July and helped his team to a 4–0 away win over Welsh champions Rhyl in the first match of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round. Seven days later, Cléo netted a hat-trick in the return leg, opening his tally in an 8–0 victory with a bicycle kick.[9] He also scored from a penalty in a 1–1 home draw with Slovak side MŠK Žilina in the first leg of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League play-off round. On 28 November, Cléo scored a goal against his former club to help Partizan beat Red Star 2–1.[10] He appeared regularly in the second part of the 2009–10 Serbian SuperLiga, adding nine goals in 14 games, and helped Partizan clinch their third consecutive title. In total, Cléo was the club's top scorer with 22 goals in all competitions, one more than Senegalese striker Lamine Diarra, who left the club at the end of the season. On 14 July 2010, Cléo opened the season by scoring the third goal in his team's 3–1 victory over Armenian champions Pyunik in the first leg of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round.[11] A week later in Yerevan in the second meeting, Cléo scored a goal from the edge of the penalty area in the fifth minute of injury time in the first half, thus leading his team to the next round with a total score of 4–1 on aggregate.[12] In the first match of the third qualifying round, Cléo scored in the 90th minute for his team's 3–0 win against Finland's HJK.[13] Subsequently, Cléo netted both goals in the team's 2–1 return leg victory.[14] He also scored a goal in the first round of the 2010–11 Serbian SuperLiga against Inđija at home, thus continued his series of goals. On 18 August, in the play-off round first leg against Anderlecht, a game which ended 2–2, Cléo scored his seventh goal in six matches.[15] Six days later, on 24 August, Cléo scored twice against Anderlecht in the return tie, bringing his tally to nine goals in seven matches in the season. He was also accurate in the penalty shoot-out, and so helped Partizan reach the Champions League for the first time in seven years.[16] On 4 September, Cléo scored his 10th goal in the season with an overhead bicycle kick in the match against Hajduk Kula.[17] On 28 September, in the second round of the Champions League group stage, Cléo completed one of two penalties in a 3–1 defeat versus Arsenal.[18] On 8 December, again in a match against Arsenal, Cléo scored an equalizer at Emirates Stadium, however Partizan lost the game 3–1.[19] He was voted as the club's Player of the Year in 2010 by the fans.[20] On 12 February 2011, Cléo completed his move to Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande, signing a four-year deal.[21] At the time, this move set a new record of Chinese football with €3.2 million ($4.5 million) transfer fee.[22] He made his league debut for Guangzhou against Dalian Shide on 2 April and scored the winning goal in the match. Cléo started the season by scoring five goals in his first five league appearances. However, Cléo suffered a muscular strain in leg during a FA Cup match against Guizhou Zhicheng on 4 May, ruling him out for two months.[23] On 26 June, after recovering from injury, Cléo entered from the bench at the half and scored a penalty in the 60th minute against Jiangsu Sainty.[24] He scored another four goals in the next four matches, but the recurrence of a leg strain in a match against Nanchang Hengyuan on 14 July ruled him out for a further two months.[25] Cléo returned to training in late August but got injured again in early September.[26] The lingering injury kept him out of the field for the second half of the year. He managed to score 10 times in 10 appearances during the 2011 league season. After the end of the 2011 season, it was reported that Guangzhou had decided to give up Cléo for his lingering injury.[27] He was linked with France's Ligue 1 side Marseille and another Super League club Guizhou Renhe.[28] However, Cléo eventually stayed in Guangzhou for the 2012 season. On 25 February 2012, Cléo scored both goals for Guangzhou in the 2012 Chinese FA Super Cup, a 2–1 victory over Tianjin Teda, which ensured Guangzhou win this trophy for the first time in the club's history. He continued his goalscoring form into the AFC Champions League, netting a brace in the first match of the group stage, as Guangzhou trashed K League champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors 5–1 on 7 March.[29] On 15 May, during Guangzhou's last group stage match of the Champions League against Buriram United, Cléo earned a penalty in the 90th minute, which Darío Conca converted into the winning goal. Guangzhou beat Buriram United 2–1 and sealed a place in the knockout phase for the Chinese Super League side.[30] On 30 May, Cléo scored the winning goal during the round of 16 in the AFC Champions League, as Guangzhou beat J1 League side FC Tokyo 1–0 and became the first Chinese club to reach the quarter-finals of the competition since 2006.[31] Although scoring four goals in seven matches, Cléo was replaced by newcomer Lucas Barrios in the 30-man squad which was submitted for the next stage of the Champions League. On 18 August, in an interview after a league match against Changchun Yatai, in which Cléo scored a goal and made an assist to help Guangzhou to a 2–1 win, Cléo stated his disappointment with the club's decision to exclude him from the Champions League squad and would seek a transfer at the end of the season.[32] Cléo played as a regular starter in the domestic competitions and helped Guangzhou Evergrande win their second Super League championship and first FA Cup title. On 25 January 2013, Cléo moved to Japanese club Kashiwa Reysol on a one-year loan deal.[33] He made 27 appearances and scored nine goals in the 2013 J.League Division 1. In November, Cléo was diagnosed with appendicitis and his loan spell was cut short by the Japanese club.[34] He then returned to Guangzhou Evergrande and was released in early 2014.[35] After leaving Asia, Cléo returned to his homeland and started training with his former club Atlético Paranaense in May 2014.[36] He signed a permanent contract shortly after.[37] On 29 May, Cléo made his second debut for the club in a 2–2 home draw with São Paulo. He stepped on the pitch in the 77th minute and managed to score little more than 10 minutes later with a volley kick.[38] Throughout the 2014 Brasileirão, Cléo appeared in 20 games and scored nine times, making him the team's highest scorer that year. On 29 February 2016, Cléo signed a contract with Série B club Goiás,[39] being officially presented two days later.[40] He scored a hat-trick in his team's 5–3 success against Trindade, helping the side win the Campeonato Goiano the same year. In August 2017, Cléo returned to Portugal and signed with newly promoted LigaPro club Cova da Piedade on a one-year deal.[41] He was the team's top scorer in the 2017–18 season with 12 goals in all competitions. In July 2018, Cléo signed with China League One club Qingdao Huanghai, returning to Chinese football after six years.[42] He was the team's top scorer over the next two seasons, helping them win the 2019 China League One and get promotion to the Chinese Super League for the first time in history. In August 2010, Cléo expressed his desire to play for the Serbia national team.[43] He applied for Serbian citizenship the following month after meeting with Ivica Dačić, the Minister of Internal Affairs.[44] On 23 September 2010, Cléo became a citizen of Serbia.[45] However, Cléo never received a call-up for the Serbia national team, failing to satisfy a 5-year residency requirement.[46]","Cléverson Gabriel Córdova","[""Cléverson Gabriel Córdova"",""Guangzhou"",""Partizan"",""Guangzhou Evergrande"",""seasons"",""citizenship."",""game"",""UEFA Champions

"74502",":Article"," Pedro Ochoa (February 22, 1900 – September 5, 1947) was an Argentine football forward. At club level, he played his entire career for Racing Club, where he won 12 titles with the team. He debuted with the Racing senior team at the age of 16, soon becoming a fan favourite due to his conditions and skills as a playmaker. Ochoa played his entire club career for Racing Club, where he won six league championships, 4 national cups and 2 international cups. He was nicknamed ""Ochoíta"" and El rey de la gambeta (The king of dribbling) due to his outstanding skills with the ball. He was admired by Carlos Gardel, who sang the tango ""Patadura"" (a lunfardo word for a ""two left feet man"") written by José López Ares and Enrique Carrera Sotelo. The tango mentions several notable footballers of those years, such as Ochoa (referring him as Ochoíta), Manuel Seoane, Luis Monti and Domingo Tarasconi (as Tarasca).[1][2] Avoiding defenders with passes and dribblings, and being like Ochoíta, the fan's favourite Ochoa was part of the Argentina national team in the 1928 Olympic games, but he did not play in any matches.[3] In 1931 he retired from football. Ochoa died at 47 years old, in Tandil, Buenos Aires Province. If I think before playing? Sometimes I do, but when I dribble a player and immediately another one appears, and then another... I can't think anymore because I do not feel like playing.

"74503",":Article","  Casey Jean Stoney MBE[4][5] (born 13 May 1982) is an English professional football manager and former player who is the head coach of San Diego Wave.[6] A versatile defender, she was capped more than 100 times for the England women's national football team since making her debut in 2000. After being a non-playing squad member at UEFA Women's Euro 2005, she was an integral part of the England teams which reached the UEFA Women's Euro 2009 final and the quarter finals of the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2007 and 2011. In 2012, Stoney succeeded Faye White as the England captain and also became captain of the newly formed Team GB squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[7] She ended her playing career at Liverpool Ladies. She was the first head coach of the newly-formed Manchester United Women from June 2018 to May 2021.In the inaugural season, United won the FA Women's Championship title and promotion to the FA WSL. On 14 July 2021, Stoney was announced as the head coach of San Diego Wave FC, which began play in 2022.[8][9] Stoney joined Chelsea Ladies, aged 12,[10] before moving to Arsenal Ladies in 1999. Already an England international, Stoney joined Charlton Athletic Ladies in the summer of 2002 in search of regular first-team football. She also took up a scholarship at The Football Association's National Player Development Centre at Loughborough University.[11] In a successful first season Stoney captained Charlton to their first FA Women's Cup final.[12] She led Charlton to success in the FA Women's Premier League Cup in 2004,[13] the FA Women's Cup in 2005 as Charlton beat Everton 1–0,[2] and the 2–1 victory over Arsenal in the 2006 Premier League Cup.[14] When Charlton disbanded their entire women's section following the relegation of Charlton Athletic men's team in 2007, Stoney said:[15] I'm disgusted with the club – the men get relegated and we get punished. The club's only trophies in recent years have been won by the women's team – and in the last four seasons we were the only side apart from Arsenal to win major honours. Seven weeks ago we played in front of a record crowd at the FA Cup final – that's now our last match and I'm totally gutted for everyone involved on the women's side. I just hope that what has happened to us doesn't reverberate around the women's game – otherwise it will be in serious trouble. In July 2007, she signed for Chelsea Ladies along with Charlton and England teammate Eniola Aluko.[10] In February 2009, she became player-manager until the end of the season, following the resignation of Steve Jones.[16] At Stoney's recommendation, Matt Beard took over as manager for 2009–10.[17] On 13 March 2010 Stoney announced on Twitter that she had signed for FA WSL rivals Lincoln Ladies to play alongside England stars such as Sue Smith and Jess Clarke. Stoney stated that Lincoln offered the prospect of full-time training, which Chelsea were unable to match.[18] Keith Boanas, her manager at Charlton, revealed that Stoney is a Chelsea supporter so found the decision extremely difficult.[19] Stoney re-joined Arsenal on a two-year deal for the 2014 season, citing her desire to win more trophies.[20] On 13 December 2016, Liverpool confirmed that Stoney had signed with the club.[21] She played her last match at the club on 21 February 2018. She subsequently retired to take a role in Phil Neville's backroom team in the England women's national team.[22] Stoney came through England's under-age squads, making her debut for the senior team in August 2000 as a substitute against France. She was named in the provisional 30-player squad for Euro 2001 but did not make the final list of 20 and remained on the standby list. She made her first start in March 2002 against Norway,[23] and, after spells in central defence[12] and at right back,[24] went on to become England's first choice left back.[25] In February 2003 Stoney wore the captain's armband when regular skipper Karen Walker was substituted in a 1–0 friendly defeat by Italy.[12] Her first senior international goal came as England beat Portugal 4–0 in the Algarve Cup in March 2005.[2] Stoney was named in the squad for Euro 2005, hosted in England, but remained unused as the hosts made a group stage exit. Her disappointment was such that she considered retiring from international football.[26] But by the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China, Stoney, preferred to Rachel Unitt at left back, was one of four England players to play every minute of every match as they lost a quarter final 3–0 to the United States.[27] Stoney won the Nationwide International Player of the Year award for the 2007–08 season, ahead of Anita Asante and Alex Scott.[28] In May 2009, Stoney was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association (FA).[29] At the Euro 2009 final tournament in Finland, Stoney recovered from a red card in a 2–1 opening match defeat by Italy[30] to help England reach the final. Stoney explained that for many players this was not only the best moment of their careers, but possibly the happiest moment in their lives.[31] Stoney started all four of England's games at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, and converted her kick in the quarter-final penalty shoot-out defeat to France.[32] When pregnant Faye White retired from international football in 2012, Hope Powell appointed Stoney as the new England captain. ""It's an absolute honour, the biggest privilege I've ever been given,"" was Stoney's response.[26] In 2013, Stoney became the first female member of the Professional Footballers' Association's management committee.[33] She led England into their Euro 2013 campaign but the team performed poorly and finished in last place, to her ""bitter disappointment"".[34] When England's longstanding manager Hope Powell was sacked, Stoney was left out of new boss Mark Sampson's first squad due to a foot injury. Sampson informed Stoney that her captaincy was under review, a decision she understood.[35] Steph Houghton was then named as her successor as captain.[36] After being called for her third straight World Cup, Stoney said the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada would be her last.[37] Mostly coming out of the bench, Stoney was part of the first English team to qualify for the semi-finals.[38] She was part of the England squad which reached the semi-finals of UEFA Women's Euro 2017 and played her last international match in a friendly against France on 21 October 2017. She was allotted 134 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[39][40] In June 2012, Stoney was named in the 18-player Great Britain squad formed for the 2012 London Olympics.[41] The group was selected by England manager Hope Powell and comprised 16 English players plus Scots Kim Little and Ifeoma Dieke. Stoney was confirmed in her role as captain.[42] Stoney scored in the team's second group stage match, a 3–0 win over Cameroon.[43] After winning all three matches and finishing at the top of the table for Group E, Great Britain advanced to the quarter finals where they faced Canada in front of 28,828 spectators at City of Coventry Stadium. Stoney was disappointed when Great Britain lost 2–0 and were knocked out. She argued for the continued participation of Great Britain at future Olympic football tournaments.[44] England's third-place finish at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup secured Great Britain's qualification for the 2016 Rio Olympics, but the team were blocked from competing due to political infighting among the ""Home Nations"". A 2016 UEFA Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament was convened instead.[45] In February 2009, she became Chelsea Ladies' player-manager until June 2009 following the resignation of Steve Jones.[16][17] Following her retirement in 2018, Stoney joined Phil Neville's backroom team in the England women's national team.[22] On 8 June 2018, Stoney was appointed as the first head coach of the newly-formed Manchester United Women.[46] Stoney's first game in charge of United was a North West derby victory in the League Cup.[47] In the inaugural season, United won the FA Women's Championship title and promotion to the FA WSL; winning 18 of 20 games and losing only once.[48][49][50] In addition to the division title, Stoney guided United to an FA Cup quarter-final and League Cup semi-final, beating four WSL teams in the process.[51][52] On the opening weekend of the 2019–20 FA WSL season, Stoney managed United in the team's first Manchester derby in front of a crowd of 31,213, an English domestic women's league record. Manchester United lost 1–0,[53] but prevailed six weeks later in the League Cup to earn her and the club's first Manchester derby win, beating Manchester City 2–0.[54] On 8 November 2019, Stoney signed a contract extension with Manchester United, keeping her at the club until 2022.[55] During the season, Stoney was a vocal critic of the quality of refereeing within the WSL, calling it ""substandard"" following United's 1–0 loss to Chelsea on 17 November 2019.[56][57] Stoney's United, again, drew considerable media attention in February 2020 following a controversial phantom handball penalty decision against Katie Zelem in United's 1–1 draw with Reading.[58][59] On 12 May 2021, it was announced Stoney would be stepping down as Manchester United manager at the end of the season having secured a second successive fourth-place league finish, one point behind Arsenal in the final Champions League qualification spot.[60][61] On 14 July 2021, Stoney was announced as the head coach of San Diego Wave FC, which began play in 2022.[62][63] Wave FC completed its first competition under Stoney, the 2022 NWSL Challenge Cup, with a third-place group stage finish in the West Division on a 1–3–2 record.[64] Wave FC completed its first season under Stoney in third place on the league table with a 10–6–6 record. Stoney was named the league's coach of the year, Wave FC goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan was named the league's goalkeeper of the year,[65] and Wave FC striker Alex Morgan won the league's golden boot.[66] Wave FC advanced to the NWSL Playoffs and defeated Chicago Red Stars 2–1 in extra time to advance to the semifinals,[67] where they lost to eventual champions Portland Thorns FC.[65] In November 2012, Stoney was named 50th on The Independent newspaper's Pink List of influential lesbian and gay people in the United Kingdom.[68] On 10 February 2014, Stoney first publicly acknowledged that she was a lesbian.[69] She is in a relationship with her former Lincoln team mate Megan Harris.[70] On 16 July 2014, she announced that Harris was pregnant with twins,[71] who were born on 8 November 2014.[72] Stoney's third child was born on 12 December 2017. In May 2015, the University of Essex awarded Stoney an honorary degree.[73] Stoney was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours for services to football.[74] Arsenal Charlton Athletic England Individual Manchester United San Diego Wave Individual","Casey Stoney","[""Casey Jean Stoney MBE"",""football manager"",""Chelsea"",""Faye

"74504",":Article","  Rachel Brown (born 2 July 1980) is an English former football goalkeeper who played for Liverpool from 1995 to 1998, spent five years from 1998 playing varsity soccer for Alabama Crimson Tide and Pittsburgh Panthers in the US college system, and played for Everton from 2003 until 2014. She also spent the 2003 season on loan in the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild, playing for ÍBV. Since making her debut for the England women's national football team in 1997, Brown won over 80 caps. She understudied Pauline Cope in her first years with the national team, then served as England's first choice goalkeeper at the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup and UEFA Women's Euro 2009. Due to injuries, Brown was displaced in the team by Karen Bardsley for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. She was also selected in the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. Brown was the goalkeeper on Channel Five's Superstars and is employed by Everton FC's Community Project.[3] She married professional golf caddie Ian Finnis in 2013 and has since been known as Rachel Brown-Finnis. Brown was born in Burnley, Lancashire, and attended St Christopher's CE High School in Accrington.[4] She began playing football as a goalkeeper at primary school, in a boys' team.[5] She said: ""They were reluctant to let me join in. It was a case of, 'OK, if you must play you'd better go in goal.'""[6] After a few years of not playing in a team, due to The Football Association (FA) rules prohibiting mixed gender teams, Brown joined Accrington Ladies.[note 1][5] Being younger than the required 14, Brown played local open age football for the club. Just after her 15th birthday, Brown joined Premier League National Division team Liverpool Ladies. She was scouted at an Easter holidays goalkeeping camp run by Bob Wilson in London, where Brown was the only female of 48 attendees.[5] After applying for the camp through Match magazine, Brown was presented with the Player of the Camp award by David Seaman.[7] Having expected to understudy Liverpool's experienced former England goalkeeper Tracey Davidson, Brown became first choice when Davidson quit football approximately three weeks later.[5] Brown's Liverpool debut came against all–conquering Arsenal on the opening day of the 1995–96 season.[5] Liverpool lost the match, staged at Anfield, 6–0.[8] A decade later, Brown recalled the occasion: ""It was very, very daunting – yeah we lost big time! Being thrown in the deep end was an understatement – I was only small and it was hard enough playing against women never mind some of the best players in the whole country.""[5] The first season culminated in one of Brown’s early career highlights; participation in the 1996 FA Women's Cup Final at 15 years old with Liverpool.[9][note 2] After a 1–1 score with Croydon at The Den, Liverpool, with Brown carrying an injury, ultimately lost on penalties after extra time.[10] Brown remained with Liverpool while taking A Levels at Nelson and Colne College.[11] In October 1997 she saved three times in a penalty shootout as the Reds eliminated Doncaster Belles in the first round of the FA Women's Premier League Cup.[12] In that season's FA Women's Cup Liverpool were thrown out after Jody Handley played in a 3–1 quarter final win over Millwall Lionesses without international clearance.[13] In 1998, Brown moved to the United States where she attended the University of Alabama and played for the Crimson Tide soccer team. The Sunday Mirror reported in February 2000 that Brown had signed a two-year sponsorship deal worth £100,000 with Uhlsport.[14] In the same article Brown explained that she had left England because Americans had a more positive attitude towards women's football. Dissatisfied with aspects of the culture in the Deep South,[7] Brown transferred to the University of Pittsburgh where she played for the Panthers soccer team and completed a degree in Sports Science.[3] She was named Goalkeeper of the Year for the Big East Conference every year and also holds the Panthers' record for the fewest goals conceded in a season.[15] Brown on the culture in the Deep South: There was quite a lot of racism and that didn't sit easy with me. It's where the marches and riots were, where Rosa Parks was, and it still felt really raw. They were only a generation away from black toilets and white toilets. There were Afro-American players in the sport but I felt quite awkward. I couldn't get my head around why people didn't hang out together. And the religion – there was hypocrisy with what people preached and what they then did. I did rebel. I told the coach that morally they weren't right. I was outspoken.[7] On returning to Liverpool, Brown found her old club relegated and languishing in the Premier League Northern Division.[7] She qualified as a PE Teacher at Liverpool John Moores University[3] and joined Everton Ladies in January 2003: ""Everton were in the top division so I thought, 'change codes here, go to the Blues.'""[7] She spent the 2003 summer season playing in Iceland,[16] returning to Everton in August 2003.[17] In December 2003 Brown suffered a serious knee injury that kept her out of the game until June 2005.[18] Danielle Hill played in goal for Everton in their 1–0 FA Women's Cup final defeat to Charlton Athletic in May 2005.[19] Hill also played as Everton shocked Arsenal in the final of the 2008 Premier League Cup.[20] Brown played in her second FA Women's Cup final in 2010. Ahead of the match she told the Liverpool Echo: ""I wouldn't say I'm in the twilight of my career but it's been a long time since 1996, so I'm very determined to put things right.""[21] She collected her first winner's medal as Everton beat Arsenal 3–2 after extra time. In December 2014, guest player Brown was taken to the 2014 International Women's Club Championship in Japan by wild card entrants Arsenal Ladies.[22] In January 2015, Brown decided to retire from football, citing that her body was telling her that it was time to stop.[23] Brown played eight times for the England Under-18 side[24] and made her senior debut, aged 16, in February 1997 against Germany. She entered play as a substitute for regular goalkeeper Pauline Cope, as England were beaten 6–4 in the friendly at Deepdale. Manager Ted Copeland also gave Brown some playing time in the next match, a 6–0 friendly win over Scotland at Bramall Lane on 9 March 1997.[25] Exactly a year later, Brown made her first home start in England's 1–0 World Cup qualifying defeat to Germany at The Den.[26] In October 2000, when Cope was struck down with a stomach complaint on the morning of England's Women's Euro 2001 qualification play-off in Ukraine, Brown took her place in England's 2–1 win.[27] By the time of a May 2001 friendly against Scotland at Bolton's Reebok Stadium, Brown had 11 senior appearances and was Cope's regular understudy.[28] Brown and Leanne Hall went to Euro 2001 as back-up to Cope, who played in all three games.[29] After impressing at her hometown club Burnley, where she had been a season-ticket holder as a child[30] as England beat Australia 1–0 in September 2003,[31] she was asked to turn on the Christmas lights in Burnley, but she had to cancel as she was playing for England as they beat Scotland 5–0 in November in nearby Preston. After a long spell out with injury, Brown returned to the England team against Sweden in the last group game of Women’s Euro 2005. Brown kept her place, and conceded two goals, as England qualified for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China. In May 2009, Brown was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.[32] Brown started every game of England's women's 2009 campaign. In September 2010, Brown was controversially sent off in England's 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup qualifying win over Switzerland. Swiss forward Ramona Bachmann was criticised for her play-acting that led to the dismissal.[33] Bachmann admitted there had been no foul and apologised for her actions,[34] and Brown's red card was rescinded on appeal.[35] She was allotted 119 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England's inaugural international.[36][37] In June 2012, Brown and Karen Bardsley were named as the goalkeepers in an 18-player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[38] Brown described her selection as the pinnacle of her career to date.[39] In 1996 Brown had been a ball girl at Legion Field for the Summer Olympics, while in America for coaching.[40] Since retiring from playing, she has worked as a football pundit for BT Sport and BBC Sport.[41] Brown attended St. Christopher's C of E High School in Accrington, Lancashire.[42] She married professional golf caddie Ian Finnis in January 2013; they live in Ainsdale, Southport.[43][44] Injuries sustained by Brown include a dislocated finger, having her front teeth kicked out, several knee injuries, and a torn cruciate ligament. She has often been photographed to promote women's football.[6]","Rachel Brown","[""Rachel Brown"",""Liverpool"",""Ian Finnis"",""Arsenal"",""Pauline Cope"",""England"",""college

"74505",":Article","  Corentin da Silva Martins (born 11 July 1969) is a French former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder, currently manager of Paradou AC. Martins was born in Brest, Brittany, of Portuguese descent.[2] He started his professional career with hometown club Stade Brestois 29, moving to AJ Auxerre in 1991 and being part of the emergent side led by legendary Guy Roux that in 1992–93 reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals[3] and, four years later, achieved an historic double.[4] On 30 May 1996, Martins signed with Deportivo de La Coruña in Spain.[5] After an impressive first season in La Liga, he lost his place in the squad due to injuries.[6] He returned to France and its Ligue 1 in January 1998 by joining RC Strasbourg Alsace,[7] captaining the side against Amiens SC in the 2001 final of the Coupe de France which was won on penalties.[8][9] After a loan spell at FC Girondins de Bordeaux, Martins returned to Strasbourg and remained there until 2004, finishing his career the same year after a few months with Clermont Foot.[10][11] Martins earned his first cap for France on 27 March 1993, in a 1–0 win against Austria. He represented the nation at UEFA Euro 1996 and made a total of 14 appearances, but his international career was eclipsed by the emergence of Zinedine Zidane.[12] Martins started his managerial career in 2006 with lowly Quimper Cornouaille FC. In the following year he was named his first club's director of football, but had a brief spell as interim coach at the beginning of the 2008–09 campaign. He subsequently stayed on as an assistant for the Ligue 2 team.[13] Martins returned twice more as caretaker manager for Brest: during 2011–12, after Alex Dupont was dismissed,[14] and again the following top-flight season when Landry Chauvin was shown the door.[15] He managed to avert relegation on the first occasion, but failed decisively on the second, when he lost all of his eight matches in charge and suffered relegation to the second tier as last.[16][13] On 8 October 2014, Martins was appointed manager of Mauritania.[17] In January 2019, he extended his contract until 2021.[18] Martins qualified the Lions of Chinguetti to the 2019 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, the former being a first-ever participation for the country. However, following a poor start to the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, he was relieved of his duties.[19] On 11 April 2022, Martins replaced Javier Clemente at the helm of another African nation, Libya.[20] On 15 September 2023, he was appointed as manager of Paradou AC.[21]","Corentin Martins","[""Corentin da Silva Martins"",""midfielder"",""Stade Brestois 29"",""career"",""French"",""Paradou AC"",""part"",""side"",""Strasbourg"",""final"",""Brittany"",""Portuguese"",""AJ Auxerre"",""Brest"",""participation"",""season"",""double."",""place"",""squad"",""semi-finals"",""career"",""career"",""career"",""director"",""contract"",""football"",""side"",""loan spell"",""UEFA Cup"",""nation"",""campaign"",""club"",""spell"",""cap"",""win"",""total"",""appearances"",""emergence"",""manager"",""beginning"",""coach"",""team."",""assistant"",""La Liga"",""Spain."",""Deportivo de La Coruña"",""Guy Roux"",""relegation"",""Clermont Foot."",""tier"",""charge"",""Ligue 1"",""Quimper Cornouaille FC"",""Ligue 2"",""nation"",""Austria"",""UEFA Euro 1996"",""FC Girondins de Bordeaux"",""penalties."",""Amiens SC"",""campaign"",""Zinedine Zidane."",""Africa Cup of Nations"",""RC Strasbourg Alsace"",""country"",""helm"",""start"",""qualification"",""duties."",""Mauritania."",""Lions"",""Chinguetti"",""caretaker manager"",""FIFA World Cup"",""second"",""relegation"",""season"",""matches"",""all"",""occasion"",""Javier Clemente"",""African"",""Libya."",""Landry Chauvin"",""Alex Dupont"",""door."",""3"",""2006"",""1992"",""30 May 1996"",""January 1998"",""2001"",""2004"",""27 March 1993"",""1996"",""2006"",""2008"",""2011"",""8 October 2014"",""January 2019"",""2021"",""2019"",""2021"",""2022"",""11 April 2022"",""15 September 2023"",""11"",""1998"",""1996"",""13"",""2"",""13"",""1993"",""2014"",""93"",""11 July 1969"",""0"",""20"",""12"",""2019"",""15"",""19"",""7"",""2008"",""four"",""1996"",""17"",""2021"",""8"",""8"",""1"",""09"",""12"",""2001"",""1969"",""6"",""15"",""16"",""18"",""4"",""2022"",""1992"",""2"",""eight"",""14"",""5"",""1"",""2019"",""2021"",""29"",""9"",""1991"",""2022"",""27"",""30"",""10"",""11"",""21"",""2004"",""14"",""11"",""2023"",""2011"",""1991""]","0.0029329728623886894","true","[0.81401366,0.047937334,0.01317059,0.0067219436,0.0058326605,0.0058326605,0.0053924276,0.0053924276,0.0041928105,0.0030930191,0.0028062002,0.0028062002,0.0028062002,0.0020875994,0.002057813,0.0020460568,0.0017974268,0.0017974268,0.0017974268,0.0017974268,0.0017444028,0.0017357301,0.00159261,0.0015567639,0.0015335273,0.0013940479,0.0013806281,0.0013806281,0.0013264194,0.0012835914,0.0012715331,0.0012715331,0.0012715331,0.0012277492,0.0012277492,0.0012216414,0.0012216414,0.0012216414,0.0011251736,0.0011168937,0.0011168937,0.0011138321,0.0011138321,0.0010626934,0.0010626934,0.0010626934,0.0010626934,9.5555745E-4,9.0586E-4,8.3930703E-4,8.3930703E-4,8.1610156E-4,7.5423974E-4,7.495129E-4,7.315975E-4,7.2567875E-4,7.220665E-4,7.168023E-4,7.168023E-4,7.168023E-4,6.672548E-4,6.624615E-4,6.191828E-4,6.033416E-4,5.873704E-4,5.8605365E-4,5.8605365E-4,5.8605365E-4,5.8605365E-4,4.959894E-4,4.959894E-4,4.959894E-4,4.9331225E-4,4.3231537E-4,4.1889894E-4,4.1889894E-4,4.1889894E-4,3.679079E-4,3.679079E-4,3.679079E-4,3.4628581E-4,3.4628581E-4,3.4628581E-4,2.1736507E-4,2.1736507E-4,1.1316479E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Corentin Martins - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corentin_Martins",,,,,,,
"74506",":Article","  Matěj Vydra ( Czech pronunciation: [ˈmacɛj ˈvɪdra], born 1 May 1992) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a striker for Viktoria Plzeň and the Czech Republic national team.[3] Vydra previously played for FC Chotěboř, Vysočina Jihlava, Baník Ostrava, Club Brugge, Udinese, Watford, Derby County and Burnley. He spent two loan spells at Watford. Vydra joined Baník Ostrava from Vysočina Jihlava in January 2010 at the age of 17 for 20 million CZK (€765,000).[4] He spent six months at Baník Ostrava, where he scored four goals in 14 matches. In June 2010, Vydra moved to Serie A side Udinese and was also voted by sports journalists the Czech Revelation of the Year for his performances at Baník Ostrava in the 2009–10 season.[5] He joined Club Brugge on loan in August 2011 but returned to Udinese having played just two games due to an injury. In July 2012, it was confirmed he had been loaned to Watford for the 2012–13 season.[6] Vydra scored his first goal for Watford when he netted the winner against Crystal Palace on 18 August 2012, in a game which finished 3–2.[7] He scored a goal against Leeds United on 10 November.[8] Vydra then scored goals in successive matches in a 2–0 win against Nottingham Forest on 22 December 2012 and in a 3–1 away win over Brighton & Hove Albion on 29 December 2012.[9] He scored another brace on 12 January 2013 against Middlesbrough. Vydra carried on his rich vein of form by netting another goal the week after, on 19 January 2013 against Huddersfield and then netted his third goal in as many games a week later, scoring twice on 26 January 2013 in a 3–0 win away to Nottingham Forest. He was in fine form, and netted another goal in his next start against Bolton on 2 February 2013. The match eventually finished 2–1 to Watford, with Vydra assisting Almen Abdi's winning goal. After three matches without a goal, Vydra netted his 20th goal of the campaign in a 2–1 win over Derby County on 23 February 2013. On 25 March 2013 it was announced that he had won the 2012–13 Championship Player of the Season award in his first season in English football.[10] Vydra won the award ahead of Glenn Murray of Crystal Palace and Blackpool's Thomas Ince. Despite going on a run in which he didn't score in 13 games,[11] he went on to score twice in the semi-final of the end-of-season play-offs in a 3–2 aggregate win over Leicester.[12] Vydra's season at Watford finished in disappointment as his club lost the chance to be promoted to the English top-flight after losing the play-off final against Crystal Palace and he injured his ankle during the match, having to be substituted at half time.[13] Vydra joined Premier League club West Bromwich Albion on a season-long loan deal on 13 August 2013.[14] He scored his first goal for the club on 21 December 2013, equalising for West Brom in a 1–1 Premier League draw against Hull City.[15] On 22 February 2014, Vydra scored his second goal for West Brom, equalising in a 1–1 draw against Fulham.[16] His third goal for the club came in a 3–3 draw against Tottenham, with Vydra scoring the game's first goal after 28 seconds.[17] On 26 June 2014, Watford announced they had re-signed Vydra on a season-long loan from Udinese, with a view to a permanent move.[18] Vydra made a scoring return as he netted in Watford's 3–0 opening day win over Bolton Wanderers on 9 August 2014.[19] On 25 April, he came on as a substitute to score as Watford beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2–0 at the Falmer Stadium thus securing Watford's promotion back to the Premier League, thanks to other results going their way,[20] with Vydra scoring 16 goals in the Championship to help earn promotion.[21] Watford signed Vydra permanently in July 2015 with the player signing a five-year contract.[22] He started the 2015–16 season behind Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney in the pecking order, on 25 August 2015, he played for Watford in a 1–0 loss against Preston in the League Cup.[23] On 1 September 2015, Reading signed Vydra on a season-long loan for a fee of £2.5 million with an option to sign him permanently for £10 million if promoted to the Premier League in the 2016–17 season.[24] He made his Reading debut on 11 September 2015 in a 5–1 win against Ipswich Town.[25] He scored his first goal for the club on 31 October in a 1–1 draw against Brighton.[26] On 19 January 2016 in a FA Cup third round replay, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–2 comeback victory over Huddersfield Town.[27] In total he scored 9 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions for the club, finishing the club's 2nd top scorer (behind Nick Blackman) for the 2015–16 season.[28] On 27 August 2016, Derby County announced that they had signed Watford striker Vydra on a four-year deal, for a fee reported at £8,000,000.[29] He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 loss to Blackburn Rovers on 24 September 2016.[30] In his first Derby season he scored 5 goals, making 33 appearances in the EFL Championship with 13 of those coming as a substitute,[31] with Vydra playing in different positions with the likes of Tom Ince, Darren Bent, Johnny Russell and David Nugent all competing for attacking position roles.[32] Vydra scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 3–0 away win over Middlesbrough on 25 November 2017.[33] After the sale of previous season top scorer Tom Ince[34] and the acquisitions of Strikers Sam Winnall[35] and Cameron Jerome,[36] Vydra found himself playing in his favoured second striker position behind a central striker of either Winnall, Jerome, David Nugent or Chris Martin[37] His goals during the 2017–18 season helped Derby reach the play-off semi finals, where they were knocked out over two legs by Fulham.[38] In April 2018, he was named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year[39] and also in the EFL Championship Team Of The Year.[40] He scored 22 goals in all competitions and received the Sky Bet Championship Golden Boot after scoring 21 goals in the Championship during the 2017–18 season.[37] On 1 May, Vydra won 3 awards at the club's end of season awards ceremony winning the Player of the Year, Players' Player of the Year and the Jack Stamps Player of the Year awards.[41] In July 2018, Vydra held talks with fellow EFL Championship side Leeds United over a potential move.[42] However, after weeks of negotiations, the move broke down over personal terms.[43] Burnley signed Vydra for an undisclosed fee on a three-year deal from Derby on 7 August 2018.[44] On 30 August 2018, he scored on his debut in a 1–1 draw against Olympiakos in the play-off round of the Europa League.[45] on 22 September, he scored his first goal in the Premier League in a 4–0 victory over AFC Bournemouth.[46] On 15 February 2020, Vydra netted his first league goal since September 2018 in a 2–1 win against Southampton, that goal was later voted as Premier League Goal of the Month for February.[47][48] After Burnley's relegation, Vydra left at the end of his contract and returned to his homeland to sign for Viktoria Plzeň on a free transfer. Vydra played for five Czech youth national teams between under-16 and under-21 levels. In August 2012 he was called up to the Czech senior team for the first time, for a World Cup qualifying match away to Denmark and a friendly match against Finland.[49] Vydra played the first 73 minutes against Denmark, in a game that finished as a goalless draw.[50] He scored his first goal, a header, for the national team on 26 March 2013 in a World Cup qualifier against Armenia, to open the scoring in a 3–0 victory. Vydra also scored the second goal of the game, robbing an Armenian defender of the ball before slotting past the keeper.

"74509",":Article","  Sophie Elizabeth Bradley-Auckland (born 20 October 1989) is an English former international football defender who played for Nottingham Forest, Leeds United, Lincoln Ladies, Doncaster Rovers Belles, Liverpool, and, Sheffield United. Bradley has played for England on over 25 occasions since her debut against Austria in August 2010, including appearances at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. She also featured in the Great Britain squad at the 2012 London Olympics. Bradley began her career at Nottingham Forest, before joining Leeds United in 2006.[4] She became a regular in her first season and helped Leeds to the FA Women's Premier League Cup final in March 2007.[5] Bradley, aged 17, was named Player of the Match in Leeds' 1–0 defeat by Arsenal at Glanford Park.[6] In 2007–08 Leeds reached the FA Women's Cup final, played in Bradley's home town of Nottingham.[7] The Whites were beaten 4–1 by Arsenal.[8] Bradley progressed to captain Leeds to their 2010 Premier League Cup win over Everton,[9] having scored in the semi-final win over Chelsea.[10] In August 2010 Bradley signed a contract with FA WSL club Lincoln Ladies.[11][12] She was instrumental in persuading several Leeds teammates to join her at Lincoln.[13] At the end of the 2011 WSL season she returned to Nottingham Forest on loan.[14] Ahead of the 2014 FA WSL season, Lincoln moved to Nottingham and reconstituted as Notts County Ladies. Bradley remained with the club but suffered a severe knee injury in a July 2014 match against Yeovil Town, which caused her to miss the entire 2015 season, including the 2015 FA Women's Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, which County lost 1–0 to Chelsea.[15] Bradley returned to pre-season training for the 2016 FA WSL after a 19-month injury lay-off and undergoing three operations on her knee and ankle.[16] After failing to regain her fitness, she was released by Notts County on the expiry of her contract in January 2017. In September 2017, Bradley signed for Doncaster Rovers Belles ahead of their 2017–18 FA WSL 2 campaign.[17] Bradley represented England at youth level and captained the Under–19s.[4] She made her senior debut in August 2010, against Austria, as a half-time substitute for Faye White.[18] Bradley was named to the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup squad, and appeared as a late substitute for White in the 1–1 draw with Mexico[19] and the 2–1 win over New Zealand.[20] She started the final group match with Japan, playing the full 90 minutes of England's 2–0 win.[21] With Faye White restored to the lineup, Bradley was an unused substitute as England were eliminated by France at the quarter-final stage.[22] Bradley was allotted 176 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[23][24] In June 2012 Bradley was named in the 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[25] She was drafted into the starting line up when Ifeoma Dieke was injured, playing alongside Lincoln teammate Casey Stoney in Team GB's 1–0 win over Brazil.[26] In 2007 Bradley won a scholarship to the Football Association development centre at Loughborough University, through the government Talented Athlete Scholarship Scheme.[27] In August 2008 the British Olympic Association took 152 young athletes including Bradley to the Olympic Games in Beijing.[28] Although paid by Lincoln and possessing an England central contract worth £16,000 per year, Bradley maintained her part-time job in the care home owned by her family while playing in the WSL.[29] Liverpool Women's Player's Player of the Year: 2019","Sophie Bradley-Auckland","[""Sophie Elizabeth Bradley-Auckland"",""Lincoln Ladies"",""Doncaster Rovers

"74511",":Article","  Rachel Aba Yankey, OBE (born 1 November 1979) is an English former footballer who played for the England national team. She played as a left winger or forward. She left Arsenal after 13 years in December 2016 at the end of her contract. She is ranked among the Arsenal Ladies Legends. Since making her debut in 1997, Yankey appeared on 129 occasions for England and at the time became the most capped player ever to play for England, ahead of male goalkeeper Peter Shilton with 125 (though this record has since been beaten by several female players). She was the second English female player, after Gillian Coultard, to make a century of international appearances. Yankey was part of the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. Yankey began playing football as the only girl in a boys' team. Aged eight she shaved her hair off, pretending to be a boy called 'Ray' (an acronym of her birth names). She was able to play in the boys' team for two years before her real identity was discovered.[4] Yankey joined Mill Hill United at youth level after the club's manager, Russell Mountford, attended an annual general meeting (AGM) at Yankey's boys' club.[5][6] She also represented Brent in the London Youth Games as a youngster, and was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 2011 Yankey's senior playing career began at the age of 16, playing for Arsenal, when she spent a short time on loan with Laval Dynamites, a Canadian team, and then moved to Fulham in 2000. It was here that she was registered as the first professional female footballer in England. She joined Birmingham City before the 2004–05 season, and then, after being released from Birmingham, rejoined Arsenal for the 2005–06 season after a short spell with the New Jersey Wildcats of the W-League in the United States. Yankey, along with England teammate Rachel Unitt, played for the Wildcats for the last seven games of the season, and helped them win the W-League championship. In 2011, she helped Arsenal to another domestic treble. In January 2014 Yankey signed a new two-year contract with Arsenal. She was praised by the club's general manager, Vic Akers: ""She remains a key part of the team and her ability and experience will be invaluable in the season ahead."" As of 30 December 2016 Yankey was released by Arsenal at the end of her contract.[7] In August 1997 Yankey made her senior England debut, scoring in a 4–0 win over Scotland at Almondvale Stadium.[8] Yankey became arguably the most famous female footballer in England, having modelled new England kits, and appeared on the FA women's homepage header. She is also noted for appearing in the BBC's online BBC Sport 'Academy Masterclasses' mini-series, teaching young footballers basic soccer skills.[9] In May 2009, Yankey was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.[10] However, in August 2009 she was surprisingly left out of coach Hope Powell's 22–player squad for Euro 2009[11] with Powell believing that her form did not justify a call–up. Yankey was also overlooked for the 2011 Women's World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Turkey. But after a return to form with Arsenal Ladies, she was recalled by Powell for the 2010 Cyprus Cup[12] and won her 90th and 91st caps – as a 76th-minute substitute for Jessica Clarke in a 1–0 win over South Africa and as a starter in a 1–0 defeat to Canada. A return to form at both club and international level saw Yankey being selected regularly again by Powell, and on 29 July 2010 Yankey became the second Englishwoman after Gillian Coultard to earn 100 caps during a home World Cup qualifier against Turkey. Yankey, who was captain for the night, scored a goal and played the entire 90 minutes as England won 3–0.[13] In a World Cup warm–up friendly against the United States, Yankey hit the second goal in England's 2–1 win at Brisbane Road.[14] At the final tournament Yankey netted in England's 2–0 group B win over Japan after coming on as a half–time substitute.[15] In June 2012 Yankey equalled Coultard's record of 119 appearances for England in a 4–0 win in Slovenia.[16] She set a new record of 120 caps by playing in England's 3–0 win over Croatia at Bescot Stadium on 19 September 2012.[17] In June 2013 Yankey played in a 1–1 friendly draw with Japan and broke Peter Shilton's all-time national record of 125 caps.[18] She was included in the England squad which performed poorly at UEFA Women's Euro 2013 and was eliminated in the first round.[19] Incoming England manager Mark Sampson left Yankey out of his first squad in December 2013.[20] He stressed that ""the door is firmly open"" for her to come back in.[21] She was allotted 126 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England's inaugural international.[22][23] In June 2012 Yankey was named in the 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[24] Yankey was announced as a first team coach of London Bees in June 2018.[25] Following the departure of Luke Swindlehurst in February 2019 to become head coach of Barnet's under-18s team, Yankey was appointed Head Coach.[26] She left the club in May 2019.[27] Yankey was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours[30] and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours,[31] both for services to football. When not playing, or practising, Yankey works as a coach in schools, teaching football to children.[32] This includes hosting a CBeebies programme, Footy Pups.[33] It was reported that Yankey's middle name came about as her mother was a fan of ABBA, the Swedish pop group.[34] However, in 2010 Yankey indicated that it was actually related to her Ghanaian heritage.[35]","Rachel Yankey","[""Rachel Aba

"74513",":Article","  Daniel Pudil ( Czech pronunciation: [ˈdanɪjɛl ˈpuɟɪl]; born 27 September 1985) is a Czech former professional footballer who played for the Czech Republic national team and currently plays as a left back or left winger for Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Hallam. Pudil started his youth career in the Czech Republic with Sparta Prague. He left the club aged 18 and joined FK Chmel Blšany. At Chmel Blšany Pudil used to play left back in defence and scored two goals in eleven appearances. After six months Pudil joined FC Slovan Liberec. Though making twelve appearances in his first season, Pudil soon became a member of the first team which would win its second league title with Pudil making 29 appearances and scoring three goals. During the season, Pudil scored the first goal of his career in a 2–2 draw against Příbram on 7 November 2005. Throughout the season, Pudil would establish himself in the starting eleven at the club. In 2007, he had a trial with English side Watford, but manager Aidy Boothroyd decided not to sign Pudil on a permanent contract.[3][4] In the 2007–08 season in which he played three games for Slovan Liberec, Pudil left Liberec to join SK Slavia Praha on loan for a season and made his debut on 15 September 2007, in a 0–0 draw against Baník Ostrava; Four days later, he made his Champions League debut in a 2–1 win over Romanian side Steaua București. On 29 September 2007, Pudil then scored his first goal in a 7–1 win over Fastav Zlín; followed four days later when he scored his first goal in a 2–1 loss against Sevilla and his second league goal came in a 2–0 win over Sparta Prague six days later. In the UEFA Champions League third match in the group stage, Pudil was in the squad when Arsenal thrashed Slavia 7–0.[5] Six days later after the 7–0 loss, Pudil played against his former club in a 1–1 draw; but the next meeting soon happened again six months later, when Pudil set up a goal for Zdeněk Šenkeřík, to score the only goal in the game. Following Slavia Praha's Champions League elimination to UEFA Cup, Pudil set up a goal for Matej Krajčík to make it 1–1 against Tottenham Hotspur in the second leg. However, Slavia Praha lost 3–1 on aggregate, having lost against them in the first leg. On the final game of the season, Pudil scored in a 2–2 draw against Baumit Jablonec. At the end of the season, Slavia Praha won the league title. Due to his flamboyance and controversial lifestyle, Slavia Praha had decided against signing Pudil. Pudil signed for Belgian club KRC Genk from FC Slovan Liberec on 1 July 2008, for worth 1.5 million euros.[6] Pudil was linked with Italian sides Reggina and Lecce but Genk managed to win the race. On the opening game of the season on 17 August 2008, Pudil made his debut for the club in a 1–1 draw against Beerschot; then two appearances later, Pudil scored his first goal in a 3–1 win over Zulte Waregem on 14 September 2008. However the next game, Pudil received a red card after a second bookable offence in a 1–0 loss against Club Brugge. In his first season, Pudil scored four goals in twenty nine appearances. At Genk, Pudil had established himself in the first team during his three seasons at Genk. The next season with Pudil made 27 appearance. However, in the Europa League fourth round second leg against Lille, having loss 2–1 in the first leg, Pudil set up a goal for Elyaniv Barda but received a red card after a second bookable offence. The next season, Pudil was involved in the squad with Genk that won the title for the second time. He spent three seasons with the Belgian side before joining Granada on a five-and-a-half-year contract in January 2012.[7] After joining Granada, Pudil was immediately loaned out to Cesena for the rest of the 2011–12 season.[8] On 1 February 2012, Pudil made his debut, playing in defensive midfield, in a 0–0 draw against Napoli. Eighteen days later after making his debut, Pudil scored his first goal in a 3–1 loss against A.C. Milan. On 7 March 2012, the match didn't turn well for him when he received a red card after a second bookable offence, just one minute after receiving a yellow in a 0–0 draw against Catania. At the end of the season, Pudil couldn't help Cesena retain their Serie A status as the club was relegated to Serie B. Pudil then joined Watford on a season-long loan for the 2012–13 season, joining Czech teammate Matěj Vydra.[9] In pre-season, Pudil played his first match in a friendly against Tottenham Hotspur in Lloyd Doyley's testimonial match but after playing five minutes, he came off with a suspected hamstring injury.[10] This turned out to be a minor injury.[11] Pudil made his Watford debut, in the second game of the season, a 1–0 loss against Ipswich Town. Having played as a left back for six games, Pudil was slotted into the left midfield role and assisted several goals. On 23 October 2012, Pudil received a straight red card in a 2–1 loss against Cardiff City after violent conduct against Craig Noone. After the game, Watford appealed the decision, with support from Cardiff City and Noone himself.[12] His three-game suspension was thus reduced to one by the FA.[13] In the first match of 2013, Pudil scored his first goal for Watford in a 4–3 loss against Charlton Athletic.[14] Later in the 2012–13 season, Pudil would go on to make 40 appearances in all competitions, and at the end of the season, Pudil would return to Granada, as his loan spell with Watford came to an end.[15] On 4 July 2013, Pudil announced via Twitter that he had joined Watford permanently from Granada, signing a four-year contract.[16] Pudil's first game after signing for the club on a permanent basis came after coming on for Ikechi Anya in the 75th minute, in the opening game of the season, in a 1–0 win over Birmingham City, while his first goal would come in a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic on 14 September 2013.[17] On 29 August 2015, Pudil signed for Sheffield Wednesday on a season-long loan deal. He scored his first goal for Sheffield Wednesday in a 3–1 win over Preston North End on 3 October 2015.[18] Pudil completed a permanent move to Wednesday on 28 July 2016 for £1,500,000.[19] He was released by Sheffield Wednesday at the end of the 2018–19 season.[20] After his release from Sheffield Wednesday in July 2019, he signed for Czech side Mladá Boleslav on a two-year deal.[21] Pudil signed for Czech side Viktoria Žižkov on a one-year deal for free.[22] On 24 July 2022, Pudil returned to Sheffield and signed for Northern Counties East League Premier Division side Hallam - the second oldest football club in the world.[23] Pudil represented his country at under-19 and under-21 level.[24] He made his senior debut in 2007 and scored his first goal at this level on 21 November 2007 in a 0–2 away victory against Cyprus in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier.[25] Pudil was a member of the Czech Republic squad that competed in UEFA Euro 2016.[26] In July 2022, Pudil began working for the Sheffield Wednesday Community Programme to help coach their college BTEC football side. He combined this role while playing part-time for Hallam.[27][28] Genk","Daniel Pudil","[""Daniel Pudil"",""Czech"",""team"",""club"",""goal"",""team"",""Watford"",""back"",""season"",""season"",""season"",""season"",""pronunciation"",""Hallam"",""goals"",""goals"",""goal"",""Northern Counties East League Premier Division"",""appearances"",""appearances"",""club"",""Chmel Blšany Pudil"",""draw"",""side"",""appearances"",""leg"",""winger"",""SK Slavia Praha"",""debut"",""KRC Genk"",""club"",""ˈdanɪjɛl ˈpuɟɪl"",""league title"",""youth career"",""member"",""career"",""defence"",""trial"",""goal"",""Sparta Prague"",""FC Slovan Liberec"",""squad"",""season"",""Aidy Boothroyd"",""Granada"",""goal"",""goal"",""league"",""draw"",""side"",""loss"",""loss"",""Champions League"",""Příbram"",""English"",""debut"",""debut"",""FK Chmel Blšany"",""season"",""seasons"",""season"",""season"",""win"",""win"",""win"",""season"",""season"",""season"",""match"",""goal"",""goals"",""goal"",""goal"",""goal"",""goal"",""season"",""season"",""loan"",""meeting"",""club"",""contract."",""squad"",""game"",""game"",""game"",""game"",""Matěj Vydra."",""club"",""club"",""red card"",""red card"",""draw"",""loss"",""loss"",""side"",""draw"",""draw"",""sides"",""appearances"",""debut"",""appearances"",""appearance"",""squad"",""season"",""season"",""red card"",""Serie B.

"74514",":Article","  Steve Leo Beleck A'Beka (born 10 February 1993) is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays as a striker. Beleck began his career at Greek team Panthrakikos, breaking into the first team at age 16. Following a successful second half to the 2009–10 season, Beleck joined Udinese of the Italian Serie A for an undisclosed fee, signing a five-year deal in July 2010. A year later, Beleck returned to Greece, this time joining AEK Athens on a season-long loan. He played regularly, and returned to his parent club at the end of the 2011–12 season. A month after returning to his parent club, Beleck was loaned out for a second time, joining English Championship side Watford on a one-year loan agreement. In January 2013, Beleck was re-loaned from Watford to Stevenage for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. In August 2013, Beleck was signed on a season-long loan for RAEC Mons but returned to Udinese in January 2014. Born in Yaoundé, Cameroon, Beleck joined Greek side Panthrakikos at the age of 15.[1] He played for the club's first team in January 2010, starting in a 3–1 away defeat to Iraklis.[2] He received a red card five minutes into the second half, and consequently missed Panthrakikos' next two matches.[2] Beleck scored four goals in February 2010: once in a 2–1 loss to AEK Athens,[3] twice in a 2–0 away victory against Larissa,[4] and a further goal in a 3–1 home defeat to Kavala.[5] He also scored on the last day of the regular season, netting from the penalty spot to briefly restore parity in an eventual 3–1 defeat to Atromitos.[6] It turned out to be his final appearance for the club.[7] Beleck made 13 league appearances during the season, scoring five goals,[8] although Panthrakikos were relegated at the end of the campaign.[9] Beleck ultimately joined Udinese for an undisclosed fee on 22 July 2010, signing a contract until 2015.[10] Beleck did not make any first-team appearances during the 2010–11 season, only appearing as an unused substitute in an away game against Fiorentina in May 2011.[11] He was subsequently loaned out to AEK Athens in July 2011, on a season-long loan, ahead of the 2011–12 campaign.[12][13] He made his debut for AEK in the club's 1–0 home win over Dinamo Tbilisi on 18 August 2011, in the play-off round of Europa League qualification, playing the whole match.[14] Beleck's first goal for the club came in a 3–1 away defeat to OFI Crete on 23 October 2011, coming on as a half-time substitute with the team losing by two goals and scoring on the hour mark to briefly reduce the deficit.[15] He also scored in a 3–2 defeat to rivals Panathinaikos at the Olympic Stadium in November 2011.[16] Later that month, Beleck was on hand to score twice in a 2–0 away win against Panetolikos,[17] as well as scoring the only goal of the game a week later in the 1–0 defeat of Kerkyra.[18] He took his goal tally to six for the season when he scored the winning goal as AEK progressed to the Fifth Round of the Greek Cup courtesy of a 1–0 win over Kalamata on 22 December 2011.[19] Despite his strong end to 2011, Beleck did not score during the second half of the season.[15] He made 34 appearances in all competitions, scoring six times, helping AEK Athens secure a fifth-place finish in the Greek Superleague.[7] Following the completion of his one-year loan agreement at AEK, Beleck briefly returned to Udinese before subsequently joining English Championship side Watford in July 2012, on a season-long loan for the 2012–13 season.[20] Beleck was one of ten players loaned to Watford from Udinese.[20][21] He made his first starting appearance for the club in a home defeat against Bradford City in the second round of the League Cup on 28 August 2012,[22] having also made an injury-time substitute in a league match against Ipswich Town a week earlier.[23] In January 2013, having only made six first-team appearances for Watford during the first half of the season,[24] Beleck joined League One side Stevenage on loan for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.[25] The move caused a great deal of curiosity, as Beleck was on loan at Watford from Udinese at the time of his move from Watford to Stevenage.[26] It was revealed that international loans are recognised as regular transfers, meaning the player can be re-loaned as long as the deal stretches between two transfer windows.[26] Beleck had scored a hat-trick against Stevenage a month prior to his move, in a behind-closed-doors friendly match.[27] He made his first appearance for Stevenage a day after signing, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute in the club's 2–1 away victory at Crewe Alexandra.[28] Beleck returned to Udinese at the end of the season, having made 13 appearances during his time on loan at Stevenage.[24][29] In August 2013, Beleck again left Udinese on loan, moving to Belgian side R.A.E.C. Mons.[1] On 2 September 2019, he returned to Italy, signing with Serie C club Rieti.[30] His contract with Rieti was terminated by mutual consent on 31 January 2020.[31] On 7 February 2020, Beleck joined Serie C club Catania until the end of the 2019–20 season.[32] On 23 October 2020 he joined Petrolul Ploiești.[33] On 8 July 2021, he signed with Yverdon in Switzerland.[34] Beleck has represented Cameroon at both the U17 and U20 levels.[35] CFR Cluj","Steve Leo Beleck","[""Steve Leo Beleck A'Beka"",""Panthrakikos"",""Watford"",""AEK

"74515",":Article","  Jill Louise Scott MBE (born 2 February 1987) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.[3] The FIFA technical report into the 2011 Women's World Cup described Scott as one of England's four outstanding players; ""[an] energetic, ball-winning midfielder who organises the team well, works hard at both ends of the pitch and can change her team's angle of attack.""[4] At 5 feet 11 inches (1.81 m), Scott is nicknamed ""Crouchy"" after male international footballer Peter Crouch, who towers over his fellow players to a similar degree.[5][6] After leaving home town club Sunderland for Everton in 2006, she contributed to the Blues' FA Women's Premier League Cup win in 2008 and FA Women's Cup victory in 2010. On the individual level, Scott was voted 2008 FA Players' Player of the Year and 2011 FA International Player of the Year. Following her retirement from football in 2022, Scott went on to win the twenty-second series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and was crowned ""Queen of the Jungle"".[7][8] Scott grew up in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, and attended Monkwearmouth Comprehensive School.[9][10] A keen long-distance runner, Scott ran for Sunderland Harriers, winning the North of England Under-13 cross-country title and the Junior Great North Run,[11] whilst playing football for Boldon CA girls' team. At the age of 13, she had to decide between football or running, and chose to concentrate on playing football.[citation needed] Future England teammates Steph Houghton and Demi Stokes also played for Boldon;[12] as part of the ""Where Greatness Is Made"" campaign, plaques honouring Stokes and Scott were installed at the club in 2022.[13] After leaving school in 2003, Scott received a BTEC National Diploma in Sport and Exercise Science at Gateshead College. She remained at the college to study for a University of Sunderland foundation degree in sports and exercise development. She also played for the college football team alongside fellow Sunderland and international teammate Carly Telford.[11] After completing her diploma, both Scott and Telford enrolled at Loughborough University to study sport. Scott began her senior career with Sunderland Women.[14] In October 2005, aged only 18 years, she won the Women's Player of the Month award for September, based on her performances for both her club and country (at under-19 level).[15] Scott joined Everton Ladies in July 2006,[16] having turned down an approach from Doncaster Rovers Belles.[17] Her first game for Everton came the following month, a 3–0 defeat against Arsenal Ladies in the FA Women's Community Shield.[18] At the end of the 2007–08 season, she picked up the FA Tesco Players' Player of the Year award. Also nominated were Arsenal's Alex Scott and Karen Carney.[19] In April 2012, Scott was appointed as one of eight digital media ambassadors, one from each team, who wear their Twitter account name on their shirt sleeves to raise the profile of the WSL.[20] Scott decided to leave Everton at the end of the 2013 season.[21] During her first spell at Everton, Scott won the FA Women's Premier League Cup and the FA Women's Cup, playing in both finals. After leaving Everton, Scott signed a two-year deal with Manchester City.[22] This move proved a success, as she played her part in securing the Continental Cup Trophy for Manchester City in 2014.[23] In April 2015, Scott was shown the red card and banned for three matches for headbutting Arsenal's Jade Bailey during Manchester City's 1–0 defeat.[24] In the 2017 FA Cup Final, Scott scored in a 4–1 win against Birmingham City. In June 2020, Scott signed a new two-year contract which saw her take up a coaching role at the club.[25] At the 2020 Women's FA Community Shield on 29 August 2020, Scott was shown a red card for two bookable offences in Manchester City's scrappy 2–0 defeat by Chelsea at Wembley Stadium.[26] On 21 January 2021, Scott returned to Everton on loan for the remainder of the 2020–21 season.[27] On 25 January 2022, Scott signed for Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season.[28] On 23 August 2022, Scott announced her retirement from football.[29] At junior level, Scott played for the England Under-19s side, scoring three times in three games as England won through the first round of qualifying for the 2006 UEFA Under-19s tournament.[15] Her first call-up to the England senior squad came in May 2006, having captained the Under-19s side for the previous 18 months.[30] She made her debut for the England senior team against the Netherlands in August 2006, coming on as a late substitute for Kelly Smith in a 4–0 win.[31] She made the squad for the 2007 World Cup, coming on as a substitute in England's opening match against Japan. She went on to start the remainder of England's matches in the tournament, scoring her first international goal in the 6–1 demolition of Argentina in the group stage. England bowed out at the quarter-final stage after a 3–0 defeat against the United States.[32] In May 2009, Scott was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.[33] She was named in coach Hope Powell's squad for the 2009 UEFA Women's European Championships, scoring a late winner as England beat the Netherlands in the semi-final, having come on as a substitute for Jessica Clarke at the beginning of extra-time.[34] At the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, Scott scored against New Zealand in England's 2–1 group B win. She put England ahead against France in the quarter final, but did not take a penalty in her team's 3–4 shootout defeat following a 1–1 draw.[35] In February 2019, Scott pulled out of the England squad for the SheBelieves Cup.[36] Scott was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to women's football.[37] On 23 February 2021, Scott made her 150th appearance for the England team in a game against Northern Ireland, which she would captain and play the whole 90 minutes as England would win 6–0.[38][39] In June 2022, Scott was included in the England squad which won the UEFA Women's Euro 2022.[40][41] On 23 August 2022, Scott announced her retirement from football, a day after England and Manchester City teammate Ellen White did. Scott retired as England's second-most capped international footballer (men and women), behind Fara Williams.[42] Scott was allotted 161 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England's inaugural international.[43][44] In June 2012, Scott was named in an 18-player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[45] In 2021, Scott was announced as one of the 22-player squad for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.[46] In November 2022, Scott won the twenty-second series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and was crowned ""Queen of the Jungle"",[47] becoming the first LGBTQ+ woman to win the show.[48] Scott has appeared as a pundit for several Men's and Women's matches, including England Men's Euros qualifying games against Malta and North Macedonia, and the UEFA Women's Champions League final.[49] In June 2023, she became the first female player to captain England for Soccer Aid.[50] In March 2020, she announced her engagement to long-term partner Shelly Unitt.[51][52] Scott sometimes works at Boxx2Boxx Coffee, a coffee shop in Northenden, Manchester owned by Scott and Unitt.[53][54] In September 2008, Scott was appointed as the coach of the Women's Football Academy at Gateshead College, with former Darlington manager Mick Tait taking over as coach of the Men's Academy.[56] Everton Manchester City England

"74516",":Article","  Karl Levi Daniel Henry (born 26 November 1982) is an English footballer who plays as a midfielder for Boldmere St. Michaels. Henry was a product of the Stoke City academy who went on to make over 120 appearances for the club, also spending time on loan at Cheltenham Town in 2004. He joined his hometown club Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006, and went on to become captain of the side in the Premier League. Henry spent seven seasons at Wolves, making 272 appearances in all competitions. He joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer of 2013 and helped them to victory in the 2014 Championship play-off final. In 2017, after four years with QPR, he was released from the club upon the expiry of his contract; he later played for Bolton Wanderers and Bradford City before retiring in 2019. Born in Wolverhampton, West Midlands,[1] Henry began his career as a youth player for Stoke City in 1998. He made his first team debut on 7 February 2001 in a 4–0 Football League Trophy victory against Walsall.[2] He broke into the first team under Gudjon Thordarson in 2001–02 making 28 appearances as Stoke gained promotion via the play-offs.[3] Henry went on again to feature regularly for Stoke in the 2002–03 season making 22 appearances as Stoke narrowly avoided relegation.[4] He scored his first and only goal for Stoke in a 4–2 defeat against Bradford City on 26 December 2002.[5] This saw him selected for the England under 18, 20 and 21 squads.[6] Henry was unable to hold down a regular starting role in the 2003–04 season and was loaned out to Third Division side Cheltenham Town on a two-month deal in January 2004.[7][8] Henry played nine times for the Robins scoring once against Mansfield Town.[9] Henry came back into the first team following his loan spell and at the end of the season he signed a new contract.[10] The 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons saw Henry play a bit part role for Stoke mainly being used as a substitute. He made 15 starts for Stoke in each season and overall made a total of 34 substitute appearances.[11][12] In the summer of the 2006–07 season Henry was out of contract, and although officially a free agent, was still training with Stoke City. The club allowed him to go on trial at Wolverhampton Wanderers, who he joined permanently in August 2006 for a fee of £100,000.[13] Henry joined his hometown club on a three-year contract in August 2006 a week before the start of the 2006–07 season. He made his Wolverhampton Wanderers debut and his first start for his new club against Plymouth Argyle on the opening day of the season. Henry spent most of his first season filling in at right back and playing a few games in central midfield. He was appointed captain for the first time in December 2006 as Jody Craddock was out injured. Henry's first season for Wolves came to an end when he suffered a serious injury in the game against Luton Town on 3 March 2007. Henry bruised his spleen and was forced to sit out the remainder of the 2006–07 season, which saw him miss out on the Championship play-offs. He made a total of 34 appearances in his first season for Wolves, scoring three goals. In the 2007–08 season, Henry again impressed for Wolves after holding down his position in the centre of midfield. He went on to make a total of 42 appearances for Wolves, scoring three goals again. These goals came against Preston North End and two against Charlton Athletic, both home and away. Henry also picked up an injury against Charlton on 29 March 2008, which saw him miss the last six games of the season. The 2008–09 season saw Henry impress again for Wolves and he was also handed the captain's armband for the majority of the season as Jody Craddock was out injured. He was an integral part of the team which made an impressive start to the season as Wolves were at the top of the table for numerous months with Henry captaining them. He was in the starting 11 against Queens Park Rangers in which Wolves went on to win the game which resulted in them gaining promotion to the Premier League. On 3 May 2009, Henry and Craddock both lifted the Championship trophy at Molineux on the final day of the season after their 1–0 over Doncaster Rovers. Henry was an ever-present captain in the Wolves team in the 2009–10 season, his Premier League debut came against West Ham United on the opening day. He went on to make 34 appearances for Wolves during 2009–10, missing only four games, as Wolves stayed up at the end of their first season in the Premier League. During the 2010–11 season, Henry made 31 Premier League appearances as captain. On the last day of the season, on 22 May 2011, Wolverhampton Wanderers stayed in the Premier League after finishing 17th. A start of the new season, new signing Roger Johnson replaced Henry as club captain.[14] Henry started Wolves' first three games in the 2011–12 season, including the 0–0 draw away at local rivals Aston Villa. Before the match between QPR and Wolves, Henry threw down the gauntlet on Joey Barton as they prepared to go head-to-head at Molineux. The two (both Joey Barton and Karl Henry) were involved in a physical confrontation in August 2010 when Barton was still at Newcastle.[15] The confrontation occurred after Henry made a number of strong tackles on Barton. During the match between QPR and Wolves, which QPR won 3–0, Henry continued his strong challenges on Barton,[16] who hit back by making claims that Henry 'tries to hurt people'.[17] Henry says Barton was 'embarrassing' after recent comments.[18] Henry was taunted by a section of the Molineux crowd after being substituted,[19] when Wolves were defeated by Newcastle United by a score of 1–2.[20] He was defended by Wolves captain at the time, Roger Johnson.[19] With the arrival of Kenny Jackett as manager, Henry was transfer listed,[21] despite his contract still having three more years to run.[22] Henry signed for Championship side Queens Park Rangers on 23 July 2013 for an undisclosed fee.[23] He scored his first goal for the club against future employers Bolton Wanderers on 28 January 2014.[24] On 25 September 2017, Henry signed a contract with Championship side Bolton Wanderers on a deal until the end of the season.[25] He made his first appearance for a Bolton the next day, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–0 away defeat to Bristol City in the Championship.[26] He was released by Bolton at the end of the 2017–18 season.[27] He signed a two-month contract with Bradford City on 23 November 2018,[28] making his début for the club in the 2–0 win over Oxford United the following day.[29] On Christmas Eve, he left Bradford by mutual consent.[30] In August 2019, after eight months without a club, Henry announced his retirement from football.[31][32] On 8 October 2008, Henry was approached by manager John Barnes to play for Jamaica. On 20 February 2011, Henry was named in the 40-man England provisional squad for the game against Denmark, but did not make the final cut of 26.[33] In June 2022, Henry took up a coaching role in the academy of Northern Premier League Division One Midlands club Boldmere St. Michaels.[34] As a child Henry suffered from acute asthma.[35] Henry grew up supporting his local side Wolverhampton Wanderers.[36] Henry is a supporter of the Conservative Party.[37] Wolverhampton Wanderers Queens Park Rangers","Karl Henry","[""Karl Levi Daniel

At the 2012 London Olympics, Houghton scored three goals in Great Britain's four games, including winners against New Zealand and Brazil.

After Sunderland were relegated that season, Houghton became a target for Arsenal and Everton.[10] She eventually joined Leeds United Ladies.[10] After helping Leeds win the 2010 FA Women's Premier League Cup, Houghton signed for Arsenal in August of that year.[11] On 5 December 2013, it was announced that Houghton had signed an agreement to leave Arsenal for new WSL side Manchester City on 1 January 2014.[12] Houghton signed a two-year contract extension with Manchester City on 24 January 2020.[13] Houghton was involved with England at U16 schools, U19, U20, U21 and U23 level. She was called into the full squad for a match against Germany on 25 October 2006, when Katie Chapman withdrew with an illness.[citation needed] She was an unused substitute in the 5–1 defeat in Aalen.[14] She made her debut in the next match, replacing Emily Westwood after 73 minutes of a 6–0 win over Russia in Milton Keynes on 8 March 2007.[15] Her first start came three days later, in a 1–0 win over Scotland at Adams Park.[16] She missed the 2007 World Cup with a broken leg and Euro 2009 with a damaged cruciate ligament.[17] Houghton was involved with England at U16 schools, U19, U20, U21 and U23 level.

She became the team's record goalscorer from the left–back position, scoring in all three group games to help Great Britain to win the group with a 100% record, as well as making important challenges to help ensure the side progressed without conceding a goal. Houghton was also named left back of the tournament due to her outstanding performance during the games.[33] In October 2014, Houghton was the first female player to appear on the cover of Shoot magazine.[34] Houghton is married to former Bradford City defender Stephen Darby.[35] They married on 21 June 2018.[citation needed] On 18 September 2018, Darby announced his retirement from professional football at the age of 29 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease.[35] She was recognized as one of the BBC's 100 women of 2017.[36] In March 2023, Houghton received the Freedom of the City of Sunderland; at the ceremony, the Sunderland Echo asked how to pronounce her surname. Throughout her career, it has been typically pronounced as /ˈhɔːtən/ (HOR-tən), something which the newspaper reported ""has irritated [her] for years"", as she pronounces it as it is in the town name

"74520",":Article","  Anita Amma Ankyewah Asante (born 27 April 1985) is an English football coach and former player who is the first-team coach at Bristol City. A defender or midfielder, she won 71[2] caps for the English national team and was selected in the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[3][4] At club level, Asante has played for English clubs Arsenal, Chelsea[5] and Aston Villa, whilst also having played for Saint Louis Athletica, Chicago Red Stars, Washington Freedom and Sky Blue FC of the American Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). She also spent six seasons playing in Sweden, two with Göteborg and then four with FC Rosengård. Asante studied politics and English BA at the Business School of Brunel University in London,[6] whilst also benefiting from the UK ""Government's Talented Athletes Scholarship Scheme"", which helps athletes in full-time education.[7] She started a PhD in the United States looking at the governorship of women's football[8] and plans to complete after her professional playing career ends.[citation needed] Asante joined her first club Arsenal as a junior in 1998.[9] She became a senior player in 2003/2004 season.[7] Asante was part of the Arsenal team that won the quadruple in 2006/2007, collecting the UEFA Women's Cup, FA Women's National Premier League, FA Women's Cup and the FA Women's Premier League Cup.[10][11][12] Asante was part of the Arsenal team that made history by being the first team outside Germany or Scandinavia to win the UEFA Women's Cup.[13][14] Asante is reported to have played exceptionally well in the final.[15] On 3 July 2008, it was announced that Asante along with teammate Lianne Sanderson had joined Chelsea Ladies. Upon signing Asante said: ""I want to compete with the likes of Arsenal and Everton and hopefully get to some finals, like the League Cup Final. But I also don't want to assume anything; it is going to take a lot of hard work as well as getting the girls together to seek that ambition. But it is such a great squad here at Chelsea, with lots of enthusiasm and lots of young players. We also know a lot of the younger players who were at Arsenal before and our England team mates, but there are so many other players who want to win things and will be up for it this season."" Arsenal manager Vic Akers publicly criticized the players after their departure: ""You think you've the respect of players, and then they do that. It's a sorry state of affairs.""[16] In 2009 Asante joined New Jersey–based WPS franchise Sky Blue FC.[17] She helped the club win the inaugural WPS championship. On 6 May 2010 Asante was traded to the Saint Louis Athletica in return for India Trotter. When the Saint Louis Athletica folded on 27 May 2010, she was acquired by the Chicago Red Stars. She was subsequently traded to the Washington Freedom on 6 August 2010.[18] In December 2010 Asante returned for a second spell at Sky Blue FC, after Jim Gabarra, her coach at Washington Freedom, took the reins at Sky Blue.[8] With the demise of WPS prior to the 2012 season, Asante signed a contract with Swedish club Kopparbergs/Göteborg FC. Her first match for Göteborg was back at Arsenal in the UEFA Women's Champions League quarter final, a 3–1 first leg defeat.[19] Asante played 41 league games for Göteborg over the two seasons, scoring nine goals.[20] She won the Swedish Cup and the Swedish Super Cup with KGFC, before she signed for national champions LdB FC Malmö in October 2013. Due to a foot injury, it was not expected that Asante could play in Malmö's looming Champions League fixture with holders VfL Wolfsburg.[21] Asante, won several titles at FC Rosengård (formerly known as LdB Malmö) including the Damallsvenskan league 2014, 2015, the Swedish Cup (Svenska Cupen) 2016 and the Swedish Super Cup (Svenska Supercupen) 2016, 2017 and runners up in 2015. Anita has reached the quarter finals of Champions League three seasons with FCR.[citation needed] On 7 June 2020, she signed for newly-promoted club Aston Villa, ahead of their maiden WSL campaign.[22] Asante's first goal for her new club was the deciding goal in a 1–0 victory away to rivals Birmingham City.[23] On 26 April 2022, Asante announced her intention to retire from playing at the end of that season.[24] Asante played in the England Under 17 team. She also was a member and captain of the England Under 19s and played in the inaugural FIFA World Under 19 Championship in Canada in 2002. She won 11 international caps in all at this level.[25] She was in the first call up for the England Under 21s in 2004, a month after her senior international début.[26] Asante made her senior international début as a substitute against Iceland in May 2004.[25] Her first full international was against Northern Ireland in March 2005.[25] She scored her first international goal in only her second full international which was against Norway in April 2005. This turned out to be the winning goal.[27] Asante was named in England's squad for Euro 2005.[28] Asante played in the 2011 World Cup and made her 50th senior international appearance in England's 2–0 win over eventual champions Japan. Having been part of the English squad which reached the final of Euro 2009, Asante was confident of England's chances ahead of Euro 2013.[29] She was substituted at half time in England's 3–0 defeat to France which sealed a first round elimination.[30] In 2015, the politically vocal Asante was ""a glaring omission"" from England's squad for the 2015 World Cup in Canada. She had been the only English player to sign a petition against the controversial artificial turf used at the tournament.[31] She criticised the head coach Mark Sampson for the manner in which he informed her of her non selection, and his unwillingness to enter into further correspondence on the matter.[32] Incoming England head coach Phil Neville surprisingly recalled Asante in his first squad, for the 2018 SheBelieves Cup.[33] At the opening match of the tournament, a 4–1 win over France, Asante suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury and was substituted after 14 minutes.[34][35] She was allotted 152 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[36][37] In June 2012 Asante was named in the 18-player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[38] She played in all four games as Great Britain were beaten 2–0 by Canada in the last eight.[39] On 19 July 2022, Asante was announced as first team coach of Women's Championship side Bristol City W.F.C.[40] Bristol City would be promoted during the 2022–23 season.[41] Asante is openly lesbian and is in a relationship with ITV News Sports reporter and presenter Beth Fisher.[42] They married on 20 January 2023.[43]","Anita Asante","[""Anita Amma Ankyewah Asante"",""Government's Talented Athletes Scholarship

"74521",":Article","  José Andrés Guardado Hernández ( Spanish pronunciation: [anˈdɾes ɣwaɾˈðaðo]; born 28 September 1986) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Liga MX club León. Popularly known as Principito (Spanish for Little Prince),[4][5] Guardado came through the youth ranks at Atlas, making his professional debut in 2005 before signing with Spain's Deportivo two years later, where he spent five seasons. In 2012 he joined Valencia, with brief loan stints at Bayer Leverkusen and PSV, before permanently joining the latter club in 2015 and winning two Eredivisie titles. He returned to Spain two years later with Real Betis, where he made 218 appearances before returning to his native Mexico in 2024. A Mexican international since 2005, Guardado represented the country in five World Cups, four Gold Cups – winning the 2011, 2015 and 2019 tournaments – two Copa Américas and two Confederations Cups.[6][7] He is the most-capped player in the history of the national team with 179 appearances, and joint tenth on the all-time scorer list with 28 goals. Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, to Andrés Manuel and Teresa (née Hernández),[8] Guardado began playing professionally for local side Atlas, joining the team's youth system at the age of seven and going on to appear in two full Primera División seasons. He made his league debut on 20 August 2005, in a 3–2 home win against C.F. Pachuca,[4] and on 15 October, scored his first goal against Tigres UANL in a 2–1 away victory.[9][10] At the end of the tournament, he was voted best rookie.[11] On 19 August 2006, Guardado scored his first professional brace against Club América in a 2–0 home victory, both of them being long-range shots from outside the box.[12] His performances in his second season led him to win back-to-back (Apertura and Clausura) awards for best full-back.[13] In the summer of 2006, press speculation linked Guardado to several Serie A teams[14] as well as Real Madrid,[15] but Deportivo de La Coruña moved quickly and made an offer of €7 million for 75% of his rights. An offer was accepted and the transfer was finalised on 7 July 2007, making him the most expensive ever Mexican player at the time; Atlas retained a 25% sell-on-fee as long as it held the remaining 25% of his rights.[16] Guardado played his final match at the Estadio Jalisco in a friendly against the Argentine champions San Lorenzo de Almagro, featuring 30 minutes. At half-time, he was awarded the club's highest honor, the Athletic Excellence Award.[17] Guardado was officially introduced on 24 July 2007, with the Spanish team giving him the number 18 shirt.[18] He made his La Liga debut on 26 August in a 3–0 home loss to UD Almería[19] and on 16 September scored his first goal against Real Betis, attacking a long throw-in at the back post, in which his attempt was described as ""karate style"" finish, in a 1–0 victory.[20][21] He finished his first season with 26 games and five goals as Depor finished in ninth position, eventually qualifying to the UEFA Intertoto Cup – and the subsequent UEFA Cup, where he scored in a 3–0 group stage home win over Feyenoord;[22] he was voted by fans as the best player.[23] Halfway through his second year, fans chose Guardado as the best player of 2008.[24] Coach Miguel Ángel Lotina stated that he was a key player for Deportivo, and admired his talent and character.[25] He solidified himself as first choice, providing several assists and being charged with set pieces; he was also hampered by several injuries, however.[26][27] On 20 September 2010, Guardado scored a brace within seven minutes of each other, both penalties, in a 2–2 draw against Getafe CF.[28] On 15 May 2011, he made his 100th La Liga appearance in a scoreless draw at FC Barcelona, the third Mexican to achieve this feat behind Rafael Márquez and Hugo Sánchez.[29] He only managed to take part in 20 matches in 2010–11, and the Galicians were relegated to Segunda División after 20 years.[30] In January 2012, Guardado was voted by fans as the best player of the previous year.[31] On 27 March 2012 he confirmed that he would leave the Estadio Riazor on 30 June,[32] and contributed career-bests of 11 goals and 12 assists as his team returned to the top level as champions.[33][34] At the end of the campaign he was again voted by fans as best player,[35] and was also named the competition's best attacking midfielder;[36] additionally, he eventually surpassed Juan Carlos Valerón as the highest provider of assists.[37] On 28 May 2012, Guardado signed a four-year contract with Valencia CF.[38][39] He made his debut on 19 August, playing 66 minutes in a 1–1 away draw against Real Madrid;[40] two days later, following his five-year residence in the country, he attained his Spanish citizenship.[41] His debut appearance in the UEFA Champions League took place on 12 September, in a 2–1 group stage loss at eventual winners Bayern Munich.[42] During his first season he featured regularly at left-back, mainly due to the serious injury of Jérémy Mathieu.[43][44] Guardado scored his first goal for the Che on 12 May 2013, contributing to a 4–0 rout at Rayo Vallecano,[45] and he featured mostly in the backline the following months. On 30 January 2014, Bundesliga club Bayer 04 Leverkusen announced that they had signed him on loan for the rest of the season, with an option to buy afterwards.[46] He made his debut on 2 February in a 1–0 loss against 1. FC Kaiserslautern for the DFB-Pokal, playing as a left wing-back.[47] Guardado's playing time at both the Mestalla Stadium and the BayArena was hampered by injuries and loss of form.[48][49][50] For 2014–15, still owned by Valencia, Guardado joined PSV Eindhoven,[51] who had previously attempted purchasing him in 2007.[52] He made his Eredivisie debut on 31 August 2014 against Vitesse Arnhem at Philips Stadion.[53] He managed to wear the captain's armband within his first months,[54] won the Player of the Month award for November,[55] and on 7 March of the following year he scored his first goal for his new club, contributing to a 3–0 away victory over Go Ahead Eagles.[56] On 15 March 2015, prior to the match against FC Groningen and amidst rumours of a transfer to AFC Ajax,[57] PSV fans displayed a Mexican flag tifo and a banner in Spanish which read ""Andrés Guardado, our Golden Mexican Eagle. He has to stay in PSV Eindhoven. Our house is your house, Andrés"".[58] On 27 March, PSV announced that they had reached a deal with Valencia over a permanent transfer, for an undisclosed fee and three years.[59] On 18 April 2015, with three matches to spare, the team won the league championship after a 4–1 win over SC Heerenveen, with Guardado playing the full 90 minutes.[60] At the end of his first season, his impressive performances led him to be named player of the year by Dutch magazines Algemeen Dagblad[61] and Voetbal International;[62] his displays also led to his inclusion in that year's FIFA Ballon d'Or longlist.[63] At the start of the following campaign, Guardado came on as a 74th-minute substitute in the Johan Cruyff Shield match against Groningen, winning 3–0.[64] He contributed 25 appearances to help the side successfully defend their title,[65] finishing with nine assists as the team's second-highest provider.[49] He played a pivotal part as they qualified to the Champions League round of 16 for the first time since the 2006–07 edition,[66][67] and was also listed on Football Oranje's team of the season.[68] On 31 July 2016, Guardado was in the starting eleven against Feyenoord, who were defeated 1–0 in the Johan Cruyff Shield.[69] On 14 May 2017, he made his 100th competitive appearance for the club in a 4–1 victory over PEC Zwolle.[70] Despite rumors linking him to a possible move to Atlanta United and Los Angeles FC of the Major League Soccer,[71] it was announced on 27 July 2017 that Spanish club Real Betis had signed Guardado for a reported €2.3 million on a three-year deal.[72] The following month he was named their co-captain,[73] and on 20 August he made his competitive debut, playing all 90 minutes in a 2–0 loss to Barcelona.[74] He scored his first goal on 25 November, in a 2–2 home draw against Girona FC.[75] In December 2019, the 33-year-old Guardado renewed his contract until 2022.[76] On 4 July 2020 he made his 100th official appearance for the Andalusians, captaining the side in their 1–1 league draw to RC Celta de Vigo[77] and becoming the first Mexican to reach that mark for three European clubs in the process.[78] On 11 July, he picked up a hamstring injury in a 1–0 league loss to Atlético Madrid, causing him to miss the rest of the season.[79] Following an absence as a result of the hamstring injury, Guardado played his first match of the 2020–21 season against Valencia on 3 October, coming on as a stoppage time substitute in a 2–0 away league victory,[80][81] marking it as his 14th season in Europe and becoming the Mexican with most seasons in Europe, surpassing Hugo Sánchez's record of 13.[82] On 17 January 2021, after recovering for nearly two weeks from COVID-19,[83][84] Guardado returned to the field, coming on as a second-half substitute in the Copa del Rey round of 32 match against Sporting de Gijón, winning 2–0.[85] On 11 January 2022, following his appearance in the league match against Rayo Vallecano, Guardado became the Mexican player with the most games in Europe with 496, surpassing the record held by Hugo Sánchez.[86] He reached the 500 game mark on 13 February in the 4–2 victory over Levante.[87] The following month, it was announced that the 35-year-old Guardado had extended his contract with Real Betis for one more season.[88] On 23 April, in the Spanish Cup final against Valencia, Guardado came on as a substitute in extra time in a 1–1 draw that went into penalties, successfully converting his shot as his team won the cup.[89] Following the retirement of Joaquín, Guardado was named main captain of the team for the 2023–24 season.[90] On 18 January 2024, Guardado and Real Betis parted ways by mutual agreement.[91] On 18 January 2024, Guardado returned to Mexico and joined Liga MX side Club León, joining the club for three seasons with an option to extend to one more.[92] Guardado made his first appearance for Mexico in a friendly match against Hungary on 14 December 2005, four months after his first-team debut with Atlas.[93] He was then called up to represent his country at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany,[94] where he appeared in the 2–1 loss to Argentina in the round of 16, starting as a shifting attacking midfielder/wing-back alongside Ramón Morales[95] but was replaced by Gonzalo Pineda after picking up an injury in the second half;[96][97][98] after the departure of manager Ricardo La Volpe, his replacement Hugo Sánchez kept the player in his squad.[99] Guardado's first game under the new manager was an exhibition game against the United States on 7 February 2007, where he came on as a substitute in a 0–2 defeat.[100] On 28 February, in a friendly with Venezuela, he scored his first international goal in Mexico's 3–1 victory.[101] In the final of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup,[102] Guardado scored the opening goal against the United States. During the second half he collided head-on with Jonathan Spector while both attempted to head the ball, but recovered to play the rest of the match, which ended in a 2–1 loss;[103] he was listed as an Honorable Mention for the competition's All-Tournament Team.[104] He also participated in that year's Copa América,[102] scoring the third goal against Uruguay in the third-place match.[105] Javier Aguirre included Guardado in the roster for the 2010 World Cup.[106] He assisted Rafael Márquez in the opening game of the World Cup against hosts South Africa, in a 1–1 draw.[107] An expected starter, he lacked playing time[108] and appeared in three out of four games, in another last-16 exit at the hands of Argentina.[109] In May 2011, Guardado was called up by José Manuel de la Torre for the 2011 Gold Cup.[110] He scored his first brace with the national team during that tournament, in a 4–1 win over Costa Rica on 12 June.[111] He found the net again in the final in a 4–2 victory over the United States, as Mexico retained the trophy.[112][113] Guardado made the squad for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil.[114] As El Tri failed to progress from the group stage, he played all three matches.[115] On 5 March 2014, Guardado made his 100th appearance for Mexico in a friendly with Nigeria.[116][117] Selected by Miguel Herrera for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil,[118] he started all the games as a left midfielder, and scored in the last group phase fixture, a 3–1 win against Croatia.[119] Mexico faced the Netherlands in the round of 16, being controversially eliminated after succumbing to a 2–1 defeat.[120] Following the end of the tournament, Herrera declared that Guardado would captain the following September friendlies with Chile and Bolivia, in instances when actual captain Rafael Márquez was absent.[121][122] At the 2015 Gold Cup,[123] Guardado's first tournament as captain,[124] he scored six times en route to the title;[125] the first being a first-half effort in a 6–0 demolition of Cuba in the group stage,[126] the second in a 4–4 draw against Trinidad and Tobago,[127] and his third via penalty kick in the last minute of stoppage time in the 1–0 quarter-final victory against Costa Rica.[128] In the semi-finals with Panama, he scored twice from the penalty spot to help El Tri come from behind and win 2–1[129][130] and, in the decisive match against Jamaica, scored the opener in an eventual 3–1 victory,[131] becoming the first player to score in three Gold Cup finals, and subsequently won the Golden Ball Award as the tournament's best player.[132] He was also called up by then interim-manager Ricardo Ferretti for the subsequent CONCACAF Cup – a play-off match to determine CONCACAF's entry into the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup – against the United States, which Mexico won 3–2.[133] Picked for the Copa América Centenario squad by Juan Carlos Osorio,[134] Guardado provided a cross in the opening fixture against Uruguay that led to an own goal in an eventual 3–1 victory, but was also sent off for two bookable offences.[135][136] He took part in a further two games, including the team's 7–0 quarter-final defeat to Chile.[137] Guardado also made the final list for the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia,[138] where he appeared as captain in the group stage fixtures against Portugal and Russia, picking up a yellow card on both occasions and thus missing the semi-final match against Germany.[139] He returned to the lineup in the third-place playoff, a 2–1 loss to Portugal.[140] Following an injury scare that required medical intervention that was picked up while playing with Betis,[141] Guardado was selected in the final 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup,[142] his first as captain.[143] In the first match, he played 74 minutes in a 1–0 defeat of Germany,[144] going on to take part in all the fixtures including the round of 16 loss with Brazil.[145] Following their elimination, it was reported by Mexican sports newspaper Récord that he had played through the tournament with a muscle injury.[146] Guardado was called up by Gerardo Martino to participate in the 2019 Gold Cup.[147] In the second group match against Canada, he replaced the injured Érick Gutiérrez at the 37th minute and scored twice, helping to a 3–1 win and being named Player of the match.[148] He broke various CONCACAF-based records at the end of that stage, among them the most-capped Mexican player in the Gold Cup and the only from the country to score in four editions of the CONCACAF Gold Cup,[149] eventually winning the competition and being included in the Best XI.[150] In November 2022, Guardado was included in Mexico's 26-man squad for the World Cup.[151] In a friendly match against Sweden prior to the World Cup, Guardado made his 178th appearance for Mexico as a half-time substitute, and became the most capped player in the history of the national side, surpassing Claudio Suárez.[152] On 16 May 2023, Guardado officially announced his decision to retire from the national team.[153] Guardado started his career as a winger at Atlas, occasionally playing as a left-back.[154] He was mainly deployed in the former position at Deportivo by Miguel Ángel Lotina,[155] and changed to the latter after moving to Valencia.[43] When played as a winger, he was an incisive and quick footballer, known to play deep into the field, take on defenders one-on-one and provide accurate crosses, managing to score for both club and country.[155][156] ""[H]e will surely be the best footballer I have trained and that I am going to train [...] He is a footballer with many merits. Not only in his conditions, but in what he creates. When everyone else stops, he keeps on going."" —Former Real Betis manager Quique Setién[157] In 2014, under Miguel Herrera's improvisation, Guardado began to play as a defensive midfielder for the national team.[158][159] At PSV, manager Phillip Cocu facilitated his positional change as injuries hampered his speed,[160][161][162] as the latter began to operate as a central midfielder with box-to-box[163][164] and deep-lying playmaker qualities;[165][166][167] he later took on more defensive duties.[164][168][169][170] A creative player with excellent vision,[161][171] Guardado is also a technically proficient player known for establishing the tempo of his team.[165][172] He also has good passing and dribbling skills, also being proficient at free kicks, penalties and holding up the ball. He also possesses a powerful and accurate shot from distance, and is also capable of aiding his team defensively due to his work rate and stamina;[168][173][174][175] additionally, he was described as playing closer to the ""Iberian midfielder archetype,"" focused on possession in the center of the field, winning the ball back with smart positioning instead of tackles and then pushing it forward.[148] Guardado has cited his compatriot and national teammate Rafael Márquez as an influence in his playing style and leadership.[176][177][178] Guardado married fellow Guadalajara native Briana Morales in December 2006. Five years later, they divorced.[8] Guardado is an ""honorary associate"" of the Asociación Mexicana de Futbolistas (Mexican Footballers Association), created in October 2017. An association that its main goal is, according to him, to ""create a dialogue with league, federation and club authorities"" with the domestic footballers.[179][180] Much of Guardado's first year at Betis' Estadio Benito Villamarín was captured in the Amazon Prime television documentary series Six Dreams, in which he was one of the stars.[181] On 1 January 2021, it was reported that Guardado tested positive for COVID-19.[83] By 13 January, he recovered.[84] Deportivo La Coruña PSV Betis Mexico Individual","Andrés Guardado","[""José Andrés Guardado Hernández"",""Mexican"",""team."",""Real

"74523",":Article","  Siobhan Rebecca Chamberlain (born 15 August 1983) is an English sports pundit, commentator, and former professional footballer who last played as a goalkeeper for Manchester United. She joined Manchester United in 2018 after playing for Liverpool. Before joining Liverpool in December 2015, she had been at Notts County on loan from Arsenal. Chamberlain previously played at the top club level for Chelsea, Fulham, Birmingham City and Bristol Academy, as well as for North American W-League club Vancouver Whitecaps. She has represented the England women's national football team on 50 occasions since her debut in 2004. This included being part of the squad at three FIFA Women's World Cups and three UEFA Women's Championships. A childhood gymnast, Chamberlain took up goalkeeping at the age of 14 and was spotted by Chelsea.[2] In 2003, she left Chelsea for Fulham, who had lost their professional status and Norwegian international goalkeeper Astrid Johannessen. Chamberlain played for Fulham in the UEFA Women's Cup, but moved on to Birmingham City at the end of the season. At Birmingham City Chamberlain provided competition for Jo Fletcher during the 2004–05 season.[3] Chamberlain then played for Bristol Academy for two seasons,[4] leaving to rejoin Chelsea in the 2007 close season.[5] On 26 May 2010, she left Chelsea and signed for Canadian W-League Vancouver Whitecaps.[6] In October 2010, Chamberlain returned to Bristol Academy ahead of their inaugural FA WSL campaign.[7] She helped Bristol reach the FA Women's Cup final, played in the UEFA Women's Champions League and was named in the WSL team of the season.[8] In April 2012 she was appointed as one of eight digital media ambassadors, one from each team, who wear their Twitter account name on their shirt sleeves to raise the profile of the WSL.[9] In December 2013, Chamberlain quit Bristol Academy to sign a two-year contract with Arsenal, where she would rival the incumbent goalkeeper Emma Byrne for a starting position. Chamberlain had played every minute of every game in her three seasons back at Bristol, but craved a new challenge: ""My ambition is to be England's number one so the added competition at Arsenal is what I need at this point in my career.""[10] On 9 July 2015, Chamberlain moved to Notts County on loan until the end of the season following injury to England teammate Carly Telford.[11] She was ineligible for the 2015 FA Women's Cup Final and The Football Association refused Notts County's request for dispensation to sign another goalkeeper,[12] so Telford played in the team's 1–0 defeat despite a shoulder injury. Chamberlain failed to dislodge Byrne from Arsenal's starting line-up and was mainly used in cup matches. She was pushed further down the pecking order by the signing of Sari van Veenendaal. In December 2015, Liverpool announced their signing of Chamberlain on a one-year contract.[13] When Liverpool decided not to renew 34-year-old Chamberlain's contract in May 2018, she criticised the club for a lack of ambition.[14] On 13 July 2018, it was announced that Chamberlain would join Manchester United for their inaugural season playing in the FA Women's Championship.[15] During a pre-season friendly against her former club Liverpool on 17 July 2018, Chamberlain suffered a suspected serious neck injury and was rushed to hospital; however, checks revealed that the injury was not as serious as first thought.[16] She recovered in time for the start of the season and made her competitive debut for Manchester United in a 1–0 League Cup victory against Liverpool on 19 August.[17] On 9 September, she made her Championship debut in a 12–0 win against Aston Villa.[18] Chamberlain did not concede a league goal until United's sixth game, with Angela Addison's 82nd minute consolation goal in United's 4–1 win ending a streak of 531 minutes without conceding.[19] United clinched the Championship title on 20 April 2019 with a 7–0 win over Crystal Palace with Chamberlain having played in all 18 league matches, conceding seven goals in that time.[20] She subsequently missed the final two games of the season with a foot injury, collecting her winners medal on the last day of the season in an aircast. In May 2019, she was named PFA Community Champion of the Year for her work with the Manchester United Foundation.[21] For the 2019–20 season, Chamberlain took part in a reduced training programme while pregnant with her first child. She expressed a desire to return to the club full-time following her pregnancy.[22] While sidelined, Chamberlain explored opportunities with the club's social media and press team, worked as club photographer and commentated on matches for the club's TV channel.[23] She terminated her contract by mutual consent on 15 July 2020.[24] On 4 September 2020, after fielding several offers and spending the 2020–21 preseason training with an unnamed WSL club, Chamberlain announced her retirement from professional football in order to spend more time with her family and focus on her master's in sporting directorship.[25][26] She has continued to serve as a commentator alongside Pien Meulensteen on MUTV. Chamberlain progressed through the youth ranks with England before making her senior debut against the Netherlands in September 2004.[27] She won her second cap in a record 13–0 win against Hungary and her third against Sweden in Cyprus.[27] Chamberlain was named in England's squad for the 2007 World Cup.[28] In May 2009, Chamberlain was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.[29] She went to UEFA Women's Euro 2009 as an understudy to first-choice Rachel Brown.[30] When Brown was controversially sent-off in a World Cup qualifying play-off in Switzerland, Chamberlain came on as her replacement.[31] By the 2011 World Cup American-born Karen Bardsley had taken over the England team's first-choice goalkeeping position,[32] with Brown and Chamberlain as back-ups. Bardsley also retained the number one role at UEFA Women's Euro 2013. In May 2015, national coach Mark Sampson named Chamberlain in his final squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, to be hosted in Canada.[33] On 27 June 2015, she replaced fellow goalkeeper Bardsley in the 52nd minute of England's 2–1 quarter-final win over hosts Canada, as her country reached the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time in their history. Bardsley had suffered a swollen eye after an allergic reaction to the rubber crumb on the controversial artificial turf pitch, but was restored to the team for England's semi-final defeat by Japan. At UEFA Women's Euro 2017, Chamberlain was again named as Bardsley's understudy. She played 90 minutes in a dead rubber group win over Portugal and again entered play as a quarter-final substitute following another injury to Bardsley.[34] She was selected for the semi-final against hosts the Netherlands but conceded three unanswered goals as England exited the competition.[35] At the 2018 SheBelieves Cup Chamberlain won her 50th England cap.[36] Chamberlain was allotted 157 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[37][38] Chamberlain joined the National Player Development Centre at Loughborough University when she was 18, training every day while earning a degree in sports science and a master's degree in sports nutrition. She was later employed as a lecturer / coach by South Gloucestershire and Stroud College in Bristol.[27] In 2015, Chamberlain married Leigh Moore, a former media assistant at the FA. Moore was left in charge of planning the wedding while Chamberlain was away at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[39] In July 2019, the couple announced they were expecting their first child.[22] Emilia Francesca Moore was born on 31 January 2020.[40] In July 2018, Chamberlain became a member of pledge-based charity Common Goal.[23] In July 2020, Chamberlain became a club ambassador for Hashtag United F.C. following the club's creation of a fourth division women's team ahead of the 2020–21 season.[41] Arsenal Manchester United England Individual","Siobhan Chamberlain","[""Siobhan Rebecca

"74524",":Article","  Prince Christian Buaben Abankwah (born 23 April 1988), known as Prince Buaben, is a Ghanaian professional footballer.[1] Buaben grew up in the Netherlands and was a youth player at AFC Ajax, but was forced to leave the club due to residency issues. He joined Dundee United in 2007 and won the Scottish Cup with them in 2010. He played in England from 2011, with Watford and later Carlisle United. He returned to Scotland in 2014, playing for Partick Thistle on loan prior to joining Hearts. Buaben helped Hearts win promotion in 2015, during his four years with the club. He signed for Falkirk in October 2018. Buaben has made one appearance for the Ghana national team. Buaben was born in Akosombo, Ghana, but his mother took his family to the Netherlands when he was nine, as she thought that they would have a better life there. In the Netherlands where he lived for nine years, his big break came when he was playing for local side AVV Zeeburgia against Ajax in a friendly, which they lost 9–1, with Buaben notching his side's solitary strike. ""After the game, Danny Blind told my uncle that they had been impressed with me, but nothing happened for a while. Eventually, Ajax called me and I went there for a two-week trial when I was 15.""[2] A player who grew up in the famous Ajax Amsterdam youth system mostly as a striker, the 19-year-old did enough to impress Dundee United manager Craig Levein. He did not have the necessary residential status in the Netherlands to obtain the required work visa when a full-time contract was offered to him by the Dutch giants. ""In Holland, you cannot play professional football without a resident's permit, and I was not due to get mine until the following year. But, because I did not have a permit, I could not play professionally, and the club had no choice but to let me go,"" he recalls. He returned to his native Ghana and due to his family's UK status obtained a valid visa, which led to a recommendation to Dundee United manager Craig Levein.[3] Buaben joined the club as a trialist at the start of pre-season training and has impressed the manager sufficiently to be awarded a full-time contract. On 20 July 2007, Dundee United signed the Ghanaian on a three-year contract, following a successful trial period at Tannadice Park. Levein told the club website: ""He's a young player and although talented, will need time to develop and adapt. ""I see him as one for the future but have high hopes that he may break into the first team earlier than expected.""[4] Buaben made his Dundee United debut in the friendly 2–2 draw against Raith Rovers at Starks Park[5] on Sunday 22 July 2007. ""The Prince"" was an instant hit with the fan's, despite being lauded by Levein as ""one for the future"", Buaben quickly settled into the starting line-up of United after some outstanding performances especially his range of excellent passing, which got rave reviews in match reports[6] The Times Online said ""Two of Levein's cheap discoveries, Morgaro Gomis and Prince Buaben, were outstanding for United against Rangers...Both players have brought craft and imagination to the United midfield"".[7] Prince was part of the Dundee United team which won the Scottish Cup in their centenary season 2009/2010. In April 2011, Dundee United manager Peter Houston indicated that he expected Buaben to leave the club at the end of the season due to the Terrors being unable to match the players demands.[8] Buaben joined Football League Championship side Watford in July 2011, signing a two-year contract.[9] Buaben struggled in pre-season with a lack of fitness, which halted his attempts to break into the first-team. He had to wait until mid October to make his league debut for Watford, coming on for Michael Kightly in the 20th minute against Leicester City. Buaben made his full league debut for Watford against Peterborough United on 29 October 2011. Watford won the game 3–2 with Buaben instrumental in all three goals. Buaben scored his first goal for Watford in a 1–1 draw against Cardiff City on Boxing day.[10] On 7 June 2013, Watford announced that Buaben's contract would not be renewed and that he was due to be released as a free agent.[11] He joined Carlisle United in October 2013 in a deal that would keep him at Brunton Park until the end of the 2013–2014 season.[12] He made twelve league appearances for the Cumbrians. After returning from his loan at Partick Thistle. On 6 May 2014, Carlisle announced that Buaben would be released at the end of his contract.[13] Buaben joined Partick Thistle on loan in January 2014, until the end of the season.[14] Buaben returned to England in the summer having made 11 appearances for the Jags, scoring no goals. Buaben signed a one-year contract with Heart of Midlothian in July 2014.[15] He scored his first Hearts' goal in a 2–1 derby win over Hibernian on 17 August 2014.[16] Buaben's second goal came against Queen of the South at Palmerston Park on 4 October 2014.[17] His third goal came on 18 October from the penalty spot at home against Dumbarton.[18] Prince's fourth goal was a lovely controlled finish in to the bottom left corner of the net in front of the Gorgie Road end at Tynie in a 4–1 victory over Queens.[19] According to the Edinburgh Evening News on 9 December, Prince Buaben said he would like to stay at Hearts 'forever' and was in talks to sign a new long-term contract with the club.[20] Buaben went on to win the Scottish Championship[21] with Hearts but was frustrated to spend much of the later part of the 2014–15 season out injured. Bauben was released by Hearts at the end of the 2017/18 season.[22] Buaben signed a short-term contract with Falkirk on 1 October 2018.[23] Buaben received his first call-up to The Black Stars of Ghana national squad in March 2008 for the friendly match against Mexico,[24] although he remained an unused substitute during the match.[25]","Prince Buaben","[""Christian Buaben

"74525",":Article","  Claire Lauren Rafferty (born 11 January 1989) is an English pundit and retired professional footballer. She made over 100 appearances as a left back or left winger for Chelsea in the FA WSL and also spent time at Millwall Lionesses and West Ham United. Rafferty also represented England internationally and played at the 2012 Olympics for Great Britain. Rafferty became a first team regular with Millwall Lionesses as a 14-year-old.[4] After recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury,[4] she signed for Chelsea Ladies in 2007[5] and became a regular on the left of midfield.[6] In August 2011 Rafferty suffered another ACL injury.[7] She returned to the Chelsea team as a substitute in their televised 2012 FA WSL opening game against Doncaster Rovers Belles. Earlier in April 2012 Rafferty had been appointed as one of eight digital media ambassadors, one from each team, who wear their Twitter account name on their sleeves to raise the profile of the WSL.[8] In 2014 Rafferty helped Chelsea to second place in the FAWSL. There was a dramatic final day of the season which saw Chelsea narrowly missing out on the title by one goal difference.[9] Rafferty left Chelsea Ladies at the end of the 2017–18 season. In June 2018, she joined West Ham United Ladies.[10][11] She retired at the end of the 2018–19 season.[12] Rafferty was involved with England at U15 development, U17, U19, U20 and U23 level.[13] She had been called into the U19 squad at the age of 15.[4] Her full debut came on 25 March 2010 against Austria.[13] In June 2011 Rafferty was named in the 21–player squad for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. At the quarter-final stage of the competition against France, she was substituted on for regular left back Rachel Unitt in the 81st minute, to make her World Cup debut. England coach Hope Powell considered Rafferty better equipped to cope with the pace of Élodie Thomis.[14] When the match finished 1–1 after extra-time, Rafferty missed England's fourth penalty in the shootout, sending her spot kick wide of the post.[14] Although England were knocked out when Faye White also missed, Hope Powell praised Rafferty for stepping forward when other, more experienced team mates were exhibiting ""cowardice.""[15] Rafferty's international career has been plagued with injury having ruptured her ACL three times, most recently in 2013. After overcoming this for the third time Rafferty was recalled to the England squad in late 2014 for the friendly against Germany at Wembley Stadium.[16] Rafferty made her first England appearance in two and a half years in March 2015 as England won the Cyprus Cup.[17] Rafferty was selected for the 2015 World Cup and was first choice left-back as England reached the semi-finals and achieved third-place. Rafferty was unfortunate to concede a penalty in the semi-final against Japan for a push which was outside the box.[18][19][20] Rafferty was allotted 175 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[21][22] In June 2012 Rafferty was named in the 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[23] Rafferty now makes regular media appearances. In the summer immediately following her retirement, Rafferty made numerous television and radio appearances as a pundit during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.[24][25] In July 2019, Rafferty returned to Chelsea in a commercial role. Chelsea Commercial Director, Chris Townsend OBE commented on Rafferty's ""extensive experience in elite-level sport combined with her business and analytical skills accumulated working at an investment bank"" which made her an important asset to the club.[26] She studied economics at Loughborough University, and graduated in 2011.[27] As well as her football commitments she is a part-time Analyst at Deutsche Bank.[28] During the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, Rafferty was named 43rd in the ZOO Magazine ""Hot 101"" issue.[29] Rafferty married her partner Erica Cleary in May 2023.[30]

"74526",":Article","  Stephen McGinn (born 2 December 1988) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a midfielder for Scottish League One side Falkirk, where he is also club captain. He began his career with St Mirren in his native Scotland, before moving south of the border to sign for English Championship side Watford where he spent three and a half years but was on the sidelines for over a year due to a knee injury and was loaned to Shrewsbury Town upon his return to fitness. He moved to Sheffield United in June 2013, leaving the club in February 2015. After a short stint with Dundee, McGinn then had 18 months with Wycombe Wanderers. McGinn returned to St Mirren in January 2017 and helped them win promotion in 2017–18. He left St Mirren during the 2020 close season, and played for Hibernian and Morton during the 2020–21 season. He signed for Kilmarnock in June 2021. He has also represented Scotland at under-19 and under-21 level. Born in Glasgow and raised in Clydebank,[1] McGinn started out at St Mirren FCBC (formerly the Football Club's Boys Club, now Youth Football Club), aged seven. He signed professional forms with St Mirren in July 2006, making his debut as a substitute on 1 January 2007 against Inverness CT. His first full appearance was in a 5–1 loss to Celtic on 20 January 2007, also scoring his first goal.[citation needed] For the 2007–08 season, McGinn started on bench before making his first start of the season against Celtic at Parkhead on 8 December, he scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw. His second goal of the season came as the only goal against Hearts. He made his first ever Scottish Cup appearance against Dumbarton on 12 January 2008, coming on in the 88 minute.[citation needed] McGinn was named in the starting XI for the 2008–09 season, making a start against Celtic on the opening day. On 5 October 2008, he scored a vital goal against Rangers, where St Mirren won 1–0, the team's first home league win over Rangers in 22 years.[2] McGinn started the 2009–10 season on bench in the Scottish League Cup game but then went on to score on his first start of the season in a 2–1 loss to Hibernian on 15 August 2009.[3] He continued his season with a brace against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, where The Buddies came from behind to win 2–1. McGinn signed for Watford in January 2010, for an undisclosed fee.[4] He made his first Watford appearance as a substitute against Newcastle United on 27 February 2010, and finished the season making two starts and seven sub appearances.[citation needed] The following season McGinn established himself as a first-team regular for Watford, missing just four games between August and the end of February, before damaging his knee ligaments in a 1–1 draw against Doncaster Rovers. He was ruled out for the rest of the season and underwent knee surgery. McGinn returned to fitness a year later, playing 45 minutes in a reserve game, insisting afterwards that he felt good and stronger than when he got injured.[5] In July 2012, McGinn signed a new contract to keep him at Vicarage Road for another year, with a one-year option held by the Hornets to extend the deal.[6] Having failed to make an appearance for Watford during the first half of the following season, in January McGinn signed for Shrewsbury Town on loan until the end of April.[7] He scored his first goal for Shrewsbury in a 2–1 home loss to Sheffield United on 9 February.[8] In June 2013, Watford announced that McGinn's contract would not be renewed and that he was due to be released as a free agent.[9] Following his release from Watford, McGinn signed for League One side Sheffield United in June 2013, agreeing a two-year contract with the option of a third year.[10] McGinn made his debut for the Blades in the opening fixture of the following season, in a 2–1 home win against Notts County.[11] Having been allowed to join Dundee on loan on 30 January 2015, McGinn's contract was then cancelled by Sheffield United on 2 February 2015.[12] On 30 January 2015, McGinn moved on loan to Dundee for the rest of the season. He joined his younger brother Paul at the Dens Park club.[13] On 2 February 2015, he signed permanently for Dundee after his Sheffield United contract was cancelled by mutual consent.[14] On 4 August 2015, McGinn joined League Two side, Wycombe Wanderers after a successful trial with the club. He signed a two-year contract, live on Sky Sports News HQ's 92Live programme.[15] On 13 February 2016, McGinn scored his first goal for Wycombe, the only goal in a league win against Exeter City at Adams Park.[16] On 25 January 2017, McGinn left Wycombe Wanderers after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.[17] McGinn signed an 18-month contract with St Mirren in January 2017,[18] and played a major part in helping the club avoid relegation. He captained the club in season 2017–18, and was influential in helping Saints win the Scottish Championship title. After gaining promotion, McGinn then signed a two-year contract extension in April 2018.[19] In June 2020, McGinn left Saints when his contract expired.[20] In September 2020, McGinn signed a contract with Hibernian that ran until the end of the 2020–21 season.[21][22] In March 2021, McGinn joined Greenock Morton on loan until the end of the season.[23] McGinn signed for Kilmarnock in June 2021.[24] He would enjoy a successful season and win the Scottish Championship with Killie.[25][26] On 9 June 2022, McGinn signed for Scottish League One side Falkirk on a one-year deal with an option for a one-year extension.[27][28] McGinn played for Scotland under-19s in a goalless draw against Slovakia in 2007,[29] and marked his debut for the under-21s by scoring in a 5–2 win against Albania in April 2009.[4] He went on to make a total of 8 appearances at under-21 level.[30] McGinn was born to parents Stephen and Mary, a teacher. His grandfather, Jack McGinn, is a former Celtic chairman and Scottish Football Association president.[31][32] McGinn was raised in Duntocher alongside his three younger siblings, Paul and twins John and Katie. His brothers are also professional footballers. Between May 2018 and January 2020, Stephen and Paul both represented St Mirren, and the brothers were in the same squad at Hibernian for the 2020–21 season. John has also represented both clubs, and like Stephen came through the youth system at St Mirren.[31][33][34][1] In 2020, McGinn became a father for the first time.[31] St Mirren Kilmarnock","Stephen

"74527",":Article","  Thomas Christopher Ince (born 30 January 1992) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder, left winger or forward for EFL Championship club Watford. The son of former England midfielder Paul Ince, Tom Ince began his career with Liverpool, for whom he made his professional debut in the 2010–11 season, coming on as a substitute in the League Cup. He later spent time that season on loan at League One club Notts County, scoring twice in eight appearances. At the end of the season, Ince turned down a new contract and moved to Blackpool, who had just been relegated from the Premier League. In two-and-a-half seasons at Blackpool, Ince played 113 games in all competitions and scored 33 goals. He also won the 2013 Football League Young Player of the Year Award and was named in the 2012–13 PFA Team of the Year. In January 2014, he signed on loan for Premier League club Crystal Palace, for whom he scored his first Premier League goal, and returned to the division permanently at the end of the season, joining Hull City on a free transfer. Ince did not feature regularly for Hull in the 2014–15 season, spending time on loan at the end of 2014 with Nottingham Forest before returning briefly to Hull. A loan spell at the end of the season with Derby County was a success, with Ince scoring 11 goals in 18 appearances. At the end of the season, he joined Derby for a fee of £4.75 million, briefly becoming the club's most-expensive signing. Ince spent the 2017–18 season with Huddersfield Town before joining Stoke City in July 2018 for a fee of £10million. Ince spent four seasons with Stoke before joining Reading in the summer of 2022. Ince has been capped internationally for England at under-17, under-19 and under-21 levels. Ince was born in Stockport, Greater Manchester.[4] His father Paul played professional football at a high level with England, Inter Milan, Manchester United and Liverpool. When Ince was three years old he moved to Italy after Paul had signed for Inter Milan where he attended an Italian school and became fluent in Italian, the family spent two years in Italy before returning to England.[5] He became a father on 11 July 2013.[6] Ince signed for Liverpool as a youth player in 2008 and was handed a first-team squad number (number 45) at the start of the 2010–11 season. On 29 July 2010, he was an unused substitute for the first time in Liverpool's UEFA Europa League qualifier against FK Rabotnički. He made his debut for Liverpool on 22 September 2010 as a 106th-minute substitute for Daniel Pacheco in the club's third round League Cup defeat to Northampton Town at Anfield.[7] On 1 November 2010, Ince linked up with his father Paul Ince, who was the manager of League One club Notts County, signing a short-term loan deal from Liverpool until January 2011.[8][9] He signed on loan alongside 22-year-old right back Stephen Darby. Ince made his County debut on 6 November in the 2–0 FA Cup first round victory against Gateshead.[10] On 13 November, he made his league debut in the 3–1 away loss to Exeter City. On 11 December, Ince scored his first career goal, in County's 2–0 league win against Milton Keynes Dons.[11] At the end of December 2010, Ince said that joining his father at Notts County had benefited him as he had ""got a bit lost"" at Liverpool, who had tried to change his style of play. He found that his father ""wanted me to be the player that I was"" and that the move had ""given me a fresher life"".[12] Ince scored for County for a second time on 3 January 2011 in a 3–0 win against Hartlepool United before his loan expired on 10 January and he returned to Liverpool. Despite his father's repeated attempts to re-sign his son on loan,[13][14] Liverpool refused. Ince's contract expired at the end of the 2010–11 season and they would not let Ince go back out on loan unless he signed a new long-term contract.[14] Ince's father described the contract offer as ""derisory"" and called Liverpool ""silly"" for refusing to let Ince re-join his club on loan.[14] Ultimately, Ince declined to sign a new contract with Liverpool and so he left the club on a free transfer at the end of the season. On 3 August 2011, Ince signed a two-year contract with Blackpool, with an option for a third.[15] As Ince was under 24 years of age and had been offered a new contract by his previous club, a compensation deal had to be agreed.[15] Liverpool and Blackpool agreed an undisclosed fee and a sell-on clause which entitled Liverpool to 35% of any fee that Blackpool later received for selling Ince.[15][16] As Blackpool had been relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2010–11 season, Ince thus dropped down to the Championship to join the club, who were managed by Ian Holloway. He made his Blackpool debut in the League Cup defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on 11 August 2011.[17] He scored his first goals for Blackpool with both in a 2–1 win over Doncaster Rovers on 18 October 2011.[18] On 25 February 2012 he scored another brace in a 3–1 away win against Bristol City.[19] In the Championship play-off final at Wembley on 19 May 2012, he scored an equaliser against West Ham United but Blackpool lost the match 2–1.[20] The first League game of Blackpool's 2012–13 season, on 18 August 2012, saw Ince score the only goals of the game in a 2–0 win at Millwall. Following the game, manager Ian Holloway revealed that Blackpool had received an offer from an unknown club, but that Ince had committed his future to the Seasiders after talking to his father. Holloway stated, ""There was interest in Tom last week. No one has heard about it but I'll share it with you. His dad wants him to stay with us.""[21] On 7 August, he scored twice in a 6–0 win against Ipswich Town.[22] In September, he scored in back-to-back games against Barnsley and Middlesbrough.[23][24] He scored his tenth goal of the season on 3 November, completing a run of scoring in four successive games.[25][26][27][28] The previous day, Holloway left Blackpool to become the new manager of Crystal Palace. Michael Appleton was appointed to replace him. In December 2012, it was reported that Ince's form was attracting the attention of his former club Liverpool, who were preparing a bid of £4 million in the January transfer window.[29] In January, Liverpool entered into negotiations with Blackpool, but The Seasiders' asking price of £8.5 million proved too much for Liverpool after they had already signed Daniel Sturridge and paid off Joe Cole's contract so they withdrew from talks.[30] Reading made a late bid to sign him, offering a fee just below Blackpool's £8m valuation[31] the transfer window closed with Ince still at Blackpool. On 11 January 2013, Appleton resigned to become manager of Blackburn Rovers. He was replaced by Ince's father Paul. At the 2013 Football League Awards on 24 March, Ince won the award for The Football League Young Player of the Year. In April 2013, after Wilfried Zaha had moved from Crystal Palace to Manchester United for £15 million, and with Ince the fifth-top scorer in the Championship on 18 goals, Ince's father commented that Tom should be valued at £25 million.[32] On 30 June 2013, Blackpool accepted what was believed to be an £8 million offer from Cardiff City. It was reported that Swansea City were also interested in signing Ince, but were put off by the asking price.[33] Despite agreeing personal terms and passing a medical with Cardiff City, Ince turned down the move on 12 July to stay in Blackpool with his newborn child.[34] Aston Villa and Everton were subsequently linked with him,[35] but Ince chose to remain at Blackpool. In his first ten league games of the 2013–14 season, Ince scored six goals as the team moved into fourth place in The Championship.[36] However, he then went on a lean streak and scored just one goal in his next thirteen league matches, the equaliser in a 1–1 draw against Leeds United on 26 December 2013.[37] In that month, Blackpool offered him a new contract, but chairman Karl Oyston expected that Ince would leave.[38] On 18 January 2014, he played 90 minutes in a 2–0 away defeat at Barnsley.[39] It was his last game for Blackpool. During his time at the club, Ince made 113 appearances, scoring 33 goals.[40] Three days later, his father was sacked as manager. With negotiations undergoing for Ince's transfer away from Blackpool, he was left out of the squad for their matches against Doncaster on 25 January and Reading on 28 January.[41] In the January 2014 transfer window, numerous clubs approached Blackpool to enquire about signing Ince, who held talks with Everton, Cardiff, Newcastle, Hull City, Sunderland, Stoke City, Swansea City, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and his former club Liverpool again.[42][43][44] However, Ince once again spurned Liverpool's advances, believing that he was not ready to move to a club of their size.[45] European clubs Ajax, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain also revealed their interest[46] and French club Monaco were reported to be leading the race to sign Ince on a free transfer in the Summer.[47] Ince and his father Paul met with representatives from Monaco in London on 16 January, just two days before Blackpool's 2–0 defeat to Barnsley, which was believed to be one of the reasons for his father being sacked as Blackpool manager.[42] His father's departure was reported to be likely to accelerate Ince's departure from Blackpool,[42] with a domestic loan deal considered most likely as it would allow him the freedom of choice in the summer when his Blackpool contract had expired.[48] A loan move to Crystal Palace, Stoke City, Swansea, Sunderland or Hull City was considered most likely, with the deal coming down to the size of the loan fee and what percentage of his wages was paid by the club loaning him out.[49] On 30 January 2014, Ince signed for Premier League club Crystal Palace on loan for the remainder of the 2013–14 season for a loan fee of £1 million.[50] Ince made his debut on 8 February 2014, playing 90 minutes and scoring the first of three goals for Crystal Palace on the day, in a 3–1 win against West Bromwich Albion. Ince started the next two matches, a 2–0 defeat to Manchester United on 22 February and a 0–0 draw with Swansea City on 2 March, then came off the bench in a 1–0 defeat to Southampton on 8 March. He started against Sunderland on 15 March, a match that also ended 0–0, and then did not make another appearance for over a month. He was an unused substitute for the next six Premier League matches, as manager Tony Pulis preferred to play Yannick Bolasie and Jason Puncheon on the wings. He came off the bench in a 2–0 defeat to Manchester City on 27 April and in a 3–3 draw against Liverpool on 5 May before starting the final game of the season, a 2–2 draw with Fulham on 11 May. With his contract expiring at Blackpool and Ince unwilling to take up the option of a third year, clubs began to show an interest in signing him. Crystal Palace, Hull City, Newcastle United, Stoke City, Sunderland and Swansea City from the Premier League and European clubs Monaco, Olympiacos and Inter Milan all expressed a desire to sign him.[51][52] He spent several days in Monaco and then Milan discussing a move[51] but ultimately turned both Monaco and Inter Milan down.[52] He said that ""after lengthy discussions with my family I have decided that my immediate future in the game lies in the Premier League"" although he ""still had ambitions to one day play in Europe"".[52] In September 2015, he would go into more detail, saying that although there was ""nothing better"" than the lifestyle in Monaco, he ""felt the league itself and the question 'would I get lost over there?' especially being English, put me off a little."" Likewise, although the history and memories from his father's time at Inter Milan were attractive, the club was in a transitional period – ""they weren't trying to challenge up at the top again, and it was a rebuilding process. Being a young lad, I didn't want any of that, I wanted to get in the Premier League.""[53] After his contract expired at Blackpool, Ince transferred to Hull City on a free transfer in July 2014 and signed a two-year contract, with an agreement over compensation not initially made.[54][55] After much negotiation, and with a decision by an independent tribunal looming, Hull and Blackpool settled in January 2015 on a figure of £1.6 million, rising to £2.3 million, dependent on appearances and if Hull avoided relegation.[16][56] Due to the earlier sell-on clause Liverpool had negotiated with Blackpool, Liverpool received £560,000.[16] Ince came on as a substitute in both legs of Hull's Europa League third qualifying round tie against Slovakian club AS Trenčín before making his league debut for the club on 16 August, playing 82 minutes of a 1–0 win away at Queens Park Rangers. He also came off the bench in both legs of the Europa League play-off round against Belgian side Sporting Lokeren; sandwiched between those matches, he started in a 1–1 draw against Stoke City on 24 August. He started again for the club in a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa on 31 August, though he was withdrawn after 57 minutes. He went a month before appearing again for the club, playing 90 minutes and scoring in a 3–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion on 24 September. He later said that manager Steve Bruce's change in tactics, to a more defensive approach, left him sidelined.[53] On 30 October 2014, having played in only three of Hull's nine league matches of the season thus far, Ince signed on loan with Championship side Nottingham Forest until 28 December.[57] He made his debut the following day, playing the full 90 minutes as Nottingham Forest lost 3–0 to Huddersfield Town. Of the next seven matches, Ince made three starts and two substitute appearances before being recalled early by his parent club. Ince was recalled to Hull on 22 December 2014, along with Maynor Figueroa from Wigan Athletic.[58] He went straight back into the team, coming on as a late substitute in Hull's 3–1 win at Sunderland on Boxing Day. He came off the bench two days later in a 1–0 defeat to Leicester and then started against Arsenal in the FA Cup on 4 January, a match Hull lost 2–0. He came on in the 39th minute of Hull's 1–0 defeat away to West Bromwich Albion on 10 January and then went three weeks before playing again, coming off the bench in a 3–0 defeat to Newcastle on 31 January. That was to be his final appearance for The Tigers. On 2 February 2015, Ince joined Championship club Derby County on loan until the end of the season.[59][60] Derby manager Steve McClaren said that signing a player of Ince's calibre was a ""real coup"" and that he was confident Ince would make an impact for The Rams.[61] Five days later, Ince scored twice on his debut for Derby in a 4–1 win against Bolton Wanderers: a ""superb"" free kick into the top-left corner of Andy Lonergan's goal in the 39th minute and a ""thunderous"" shot from 12 yards in the 47th minute. He nearly bagged a hattrick, hitting the post in second-half stoppage time.[62] Ince scored three more goals in his next two games: an emphatic finish in a 2–2 draw against Bournemouth on 10 February;[63][64] and another brace in a 3–3 draw away to Rotherham United on 17 February, a fine curling finish into the top-right corner after jinking past several players and turning in a Craig Forsyth cross at the near post.[65][66][67] After scoring five goals in three matches, Ince declared himself ""settled"" at Derby, saying that he had ""really found my feet and I'm feeling confident"".[68] The next four games saw more good performances for Ince but no goals: he hit the post, had a free kick ""brilliantly"" saved by Sheffield Wednesday keeper Keiren Westwood, narrowly curled an effort wide and won a penalty in a 3–2 win against Wednesday on 21 February;[69] was a ""constant threat"" and placed a shot just wide in a 2–0 win against Charlton Athletic on 24 February;[70] was twice denied by deflections late in the second half of a 2–0 defeat to Fulham on 28 February;[71] and missed several chances in a 2–0 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 3 March that saw Derby register 19 attempts at goal.[72] Ince put Derby 2–0 up against Birmingham City on 7 March, slipping through two defenders and shooting low under Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, though two late goals for The Blues saw them rescue a point, with the first coming from the penalty spot after Ince hauled down Robert Tesche.[73] He only scored once in his next six games, this in a 2–2 draw at home to Watford on 3 April, before scoring four goals in his next three. The first was the second goal in a 4–0 rout of Blackpool on 14 April, a brace followed in a 4–4 draw against Huddersfield Town on 18 April and the last came in a 3–3 draw against Millwall on 25 April. He thus finished his spell at Derby with 11 goals in 18 matches. Of the 8 matches in which he scored, 6 of them finished in draws. On 3 July 2015, Derby County signed Ince on a four-year contract for £4.75 million,[74] with Ince briefly becoming the club's most-expensive signing. His record was surpassed less than one month later as the club bought midfielder Bradley Johnson from Norwich City for £6 million.[75] The sale of Ince was reported to have left Hull manager Steve Bruce livid, with Bruce saying that he ""wouldn't have sold Tom and I did all I could to keep him... we shouldn't be selling our top young players when trying to put together a team to challenge for an immediate return to the Premier League. I saw Tom as an integral part of my plans. But Derby met the buy-out clause and then it was the choice of others [at Hull] to let him leave.""[76] Ince started all of Derby's first eight league matches, also coming on as a substitute in the club's 2–1 League Cup defeat to Portsmouth on 12 August. His first goal arrived on 15 September, the only goal against Reading at the Madejski Stadium. He missed the next match, a 0–0 draw at home to Burnley on 21 September, with a minor training ground injury.[77] On his return to the starting XI away to newly promoted Milton Keynes Dons on 26 September, Ince provided a 90th minute assist for Darren Bent and scored in the 96th minute to seal a 3–1 win for The Rams.[78] Ince made it three goals in three games on 3 October, grabbing the second in a 2–0 win against Brentford. He started the next three League matches, against Wolves on 18 October, Blackburn Rovers on 21 October and against Huddersfield Town on 24 October but was taken off in the 26th minute of the latter match. He had injured his ankle but it was not as bad as first feared[79] and although he missed the next two League matches against Rotherham United and QPR, he returned to the team for the East Midlands derby against his former club Nottingham Forest on 6 November.[80] On 15 December, Ince scored his first professional hat-trick in a 4–0 win against Bristol City. The first was a low finish past City keeper Frank Fielding in the 42nd minute after a mazy run through three defenders; then he intercepted the ball inside his own half and ran through on goal before firing a shot under Fielding in the 63rd minute; his third in the 71st minute was drilled into the bottom corner after a combination with Darren Bent.[81] The result moved Derby up to third in the table and manager Paul Clement praised Ince, saying that ""he's been a little bit inconsistent by his standards so far this season so it was a very good performance from him and will be brilliant for his confidence.""[82] Ince scored again in the next match, the only goal in a 1–0 win at home to Ipswich Town on 19 December. His man-of-the-match performance also saw him provide three good chances, for teammates Bradley Johnson, Chris Martin and Johnny Russell, as well as have a 25-yard free-kick saved by Ipswich goalie Dean Gerken.[83] He missed two good opportunities in the next match, a 2–0 win over Fulham on Boxing Day,[84] but atoned against fierce rivals Leeds United on 29 December. He came on in the 76th minute with Derby 2–1 down, scoring a ""brilliant"" equaliser just two minutes later, drilling a ""fine finish"" into the bottom corner.[85][86][87] Ince then endured a difficult spell, not scoring in his next twelve league and cup appearances. After the first seven appearances, during which Derby lost five times, drew twice, only scored three goals and sacked manager Paul Clement, he lost his place in the starting line-up. This coincided with a return to form for the team, who won two of their next three matches, with Ince making second-half substitute appearances. He was restored to the starting eleven on 5 March for a 2–0 win against Huddersfield Town and ended his barren spell two matches later on 12 March, scoring a brace either side of a Chris Martin goal to give The Rams a 3–0 lead against Rotherham United. However, three late Rotherham goals saw the away side rescue a point. Ince rounded out the season with two more goals: the second in a 4–1 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers on 9 April and the 57th-minute winner in a 3–2 victory at Bristol City on 19 April. Derby finished the season in fifth place and played fourth-placed Hull City in the play-off semi-finals, losing 3–0 at home and winning 2–0 away to go out 3–2 on aggregate to the eventual play-off final winners. Ince did not score his first goal of the 2016–17 season until 27 September, the first in a 2–0 win at Cardiff City. In November, he scored four goals in back-to-back games: braces each in a 3–2 win at Wolves on 5 November and in a 3–0 win over Rotherham on 19 November. Ince ended the 2016–17 season as top scorer with 15 goals as the Rams finished in 9th position.[88] On 4 July 2017, Ince signed for newly promoted Premier League club Huddersfield Town on an initial three-year contract for an undisclosed fee.[89] He scored his first goal with the club in the Premier League on 26 December during a 1–1 draw with Stoke City.[90] Ince played 37 times in 2017–18 season helping the Terriers avoid relegation, finishing in 16th position.[91] Ince signed for newly relegated Championship club Stoke City on 24 July 2018 on a four-year contract for an initial fee of £10 million, which could rise to £12 million with add-ons.[92] He made his Stoke debut on 5 August 2018 against Leeds United.[93] Ince played 41 times for Stoke in 2018–19, scoring six goals as the Potters finished in a mid-table position of 16th.[94] Stoke and Ince began the 2019–20 season in poor form as the team struggled under the management of Nathan Jones.[95] Despite a change of manager, Ince continued to struggle to have an impact on the team and came in for heavy criticism after an anonymous performance against Wigan Athletic 30 June 2020 where he completed just one pass in 57 minutes.[96] He scored in the next match a 4–0 win against Barnsley.[97] He ended the campaign with three goals from 40 appearances as Stoke avoided relegation and finished in 15th position.[98] On 1 February 2021, Ince joined Luton Town on loan for the remainder of the 2020–21 season.[99] Five days later, he made his debut for the Hatters as a substitute for Harry Cornick in a 1–1 home league draw against Huddersfield Town.[100] Ince made seven appearances for the Hatters before he suffered an ankle ligament injury.[101] On 31 January 2022, Ince joined Reading on loan for the remainder of the 2021–22 season.[102] Ince played 15 times for the Royals, scoring twice against Bournemouth and Swansea City.[103][104] Ince was released by Stoke City at the end of the 2021–22 season.[105] On 21 June 2022, Ince signed a three-year contract with Reading, which his father Paul had become manager of in the close season.[106] On 25 February 2023, Ince scored a brace against his former club Blackpool in a 3–1 home win.[107] On 27 June 2023, after their relegation to League One, Reading confirmed Ince's departure to Watford for an undisclosed fee thought to be £50,000.[108] Ince made four appearances for England Under-17s in 2009 and another four for the Under 19s in 2011. On 29 August 2012 he was called up to the Under 21 squad by manager Stuart Pearce for the European Championship qualifying games against Azerbaijan on 1 September and Norway four days later.[109] He made his under-21 debut in the 2–0 win over Azerbaijan at Dalga Arena, Baku.[110] On 5 February 2013, he scored his first goals for the under-21 side, scoring twice in a 4–0 win against Sweden in Walsall.[111] In March 2015, he ruled himself out of selection for future under-21 squads.[112] This caused a great deal of controversy, which shocked Ince.[53] ""Bear in mind I had been playing for the U21s for the past three years, had 20–25 caps, played in the [2013] European Championship under Stuart Pearce. I was 23, and the oldest one there by a good 18 months. I felt at the time I hadn't really played a lot of club football, and I'd been getting banded from pillar to post, and needed a summer off to settle down, and plan my next move. The next move was a vital one... it is time to be kicking on. I went to Croatia in the play-offs to qualify [for the 2015 under-21 championships], and I was on the bench. I made the decision and it was time to move on. Like everything in life, in any job, you get that feeling the time is right to move on."" – Ince on his decision to rule himself out of consideration for the England under-21s.[53] Ince is left-footed and began his career as a left winger.[15] However, when he joined Blackpool, he was often deployed on the right, either as a winger or an inside forward, cutting in on his favoured left foot. He has also played more centrally as an attacking midfielder or forward.[29] Ince's main attributes are his pace, acceleration and skill on the ball.[29] He has said that he enjoys ""exciting people, scoring goals, creating goals"" and is ""not one of those old fashioned wingers who just gets crosses in, I like to create things, show bits of magic.""[53] Individual","Tom Ince","[""Thomas

"74528",":Article"," Juan Bernat Velasco ( Spanish pronunciation: [ˈxwan beɾˈnat];[A] born 1 March 1993) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a left-back for Primeira Liga club Benfica, on loan from Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain. He began his career at Valencia, featuring in three La Liga campaigns for the club. He moved to Bayern Munich in 2014, winning the Bundesliga every season during his four-year spell while appearing in 115 competitive matches. In August 2018, he signed with Paris Saint-Germain, playing in the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final and losing to his former side Bayern Munich. He suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in September 2020 that would keep him out for over a year. A European champion with the under-19 team in 2012, Bernat made his senior debut for Spain in 2014. Born in Cullera, Valencian Community, Bernat was a product of Valencia's youth system.[4] He made his senior debut at only 17, appearing with the reserves in the Tercera División and helping them to return to Segunda División B. He was brought to the main squad for the 2011 pre-season, scoring in a 3–0 away win against Sporting CP, and earned a professional contract until 2015 shortly after.[5] Bernat made his debut with the Che's first team in a 4–3 La Liga home victory over Racing de Santander on 27 August 2011; he started the game and was replaced at half-time, with the score at 2–1 for the visitors.[6] His second league appearance occurred on 22 January 2012 in a 1–1 draw at Osasuna, substituting Jonas in the 57th minute.[7] He continued featuring regularly for the B's in the third tier. Bernat scored his first official goal for Valencia on 28 November 2012, netting his team's last in a 3–1 home defeat of Llagostera for that season's Copa del Rey (5–1 on aggregate).[8] He scored his first in the league roughly one year later, coming from the bench for the 1–1 equaliser at Elche (eventual 2–1 loss).[9] From 2013 onwards, Bernat started being utilised as a left-back.[10] On 7 July 2014, Bernat signed for Bayern Munich on a five-year contract.[11][12] He made his debut on 13 August, playing the entirety of the 2–0 defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFL-Supercup,[13] and played his first Bundesliga match nine days later, a 2–1 home win against VfL Wolfsburg.[14] Shortly after being placed first in Outside of the Boot's Talent Radar Top 20 Young Players of 2014,[15] Bernat scored his first competitive goal for the Bavarians, but in a 4–1 loss at Wolfsburg on 30 January 2015.[16] On 31 August 2018, Bernat joined Paris Saint-Germain on a three-year deal,[17] replacing Yuri Berchiche who had left for Athletic Bilbao.[18] His Ligue 1 debut occurred on 14 September in a home fixture against Saint-Étienne, and played the full 90 minutes in the 4–0 win.[19] He scored his first competitive goal for the team on 6 November, in a 1–1 away draw with Napoli in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League;[20] in the following Champions League seasons, he would also score against Liverpool, Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig.[21] On 16 September 2020, Bernat suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in a match against Metz; it was reported he would miss six months of action.[22] On 16 March 2021, he signed an extension to keep him at the club until 2025.[23] His return to play would come later than initially planned, on 15 October in a 2–1 league victory over Angers at the Parc des Princes.[24] On 1 September 2023, Bernat joined Benfica on a season-long loan.[25] He made his debut on 3 October, starting in a 1–0 defeat at Inter Milan in the Champions League group stage.[26] His maiden Primeira Liga appearance took place four days later, when he came off the bench for David Jurásek in the 77th minute of a 1–0 away win over Estoril.[27] Bernat moved through the Spanish international youth setup, representing all sides between the under-16s and the under-21s. He made his debut with the former in 2009, and with the under-17 side he reached the final at the 2010 UEFA European Championship, playing alongside Valencia teammate Paco Alcácer.[28] In 2012, Bernat was part of the squad that won the Under-19 Championship in Estonia. On 3 October 2014, he was called up by full side manager Vicente del Bosque for UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg:[29] he made his debut on the 12th against the latter, replacing Andrés Iniesta for the final 20 minutes and scoring the last goal of a 4–0 win.[30] Bayern Munich Paris Saint-Germain Spain U17 Spain U19","Juan Bernat","[""Juan Bernat Velasco"",""Paris

"74529",":Article","  Daniel González Güiza ( Spanish pronunciation: [da'niel ˈɣwiθa]; born 17 August 1980) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a striker for CD Rota. A late bloomer, he made a name for himself at the age of 27, being crowned La Liga top scorer with Mallorca. Subsequently, he helped the Spain national team win Euro 2008, and signed with Fenerbahçe in Turkey shortly afterwards. Over eight seasons, Güiza amassed Spanish top division totals of 141 matches and 52 goals, mainly with Mallorca and Getafe. Throughout his career, he played in three continents.[3] Having started playing on the streets of his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera in Cádiz, Güiza used to hide behind trees in an attempt to avoid the running, despite being then coached by boyhood idol Kiko, who begun his professional career with local Cádiz CF.[4] He eventually made it into his local club Xerez CD and, after one season there, first showed his eye for goal at Segunda División B side Dos Hermanas CF, loaned immediately after RCD Mallorca bought him. Such performances saw him make his debut in La Liga for the latter at the age of 19, but he would fail to perform, being relegated to the reserves.[5] Güiza was then loaned out to Recreativo de Huelva, but could not find a secure place in the team, and moved soon after to FC Barcelona B, also on loan.[5] Subsequently, he joined Ciudad de Murcia of the Segunda División, where his career saw a turning point with two consecutive top-five finishes in the top scorers' list (runner-up in the 2004–05 season).[5] This impressed Bernd Schuster enough to sign Güiza for Getafe CF in the summer of 2005. He was an instant first-choice at his new team and became recognised as a top flight striker, scoring 27 goals in 70 competitive games – seven in nine Copa del Rey appearances – while the team from the Madrid outskirts achieved back-to-back ninth-league places.[6] The club's president, Ángel Torres, described him as ""the best finisher in the first division after Ronaldo"".[5] On 10 May 2007, he was one of three players on target in a 4–0 home defeat of FC Barcelona for the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, which meant qualification for the decisive match for the first time ever after a 6–5 aggregate win.[7] After four years, Güiza returned to Mallorca in a €5 million move, brokered by his wife and agent Nuria Bermúdez, experiencing a breakthrough season.[4] On 20 April 2008 he scored a hat-trick against Real Murcia,[8] and finished the campaign as the league's top scorer by scoring 27 goals in 37 matches, a feat achieved without a single penalty kick.[5] Club coach Gregorio Manzano said: ""In 24 years of coaching I've never had the winner of the Pichichi in my team. Dani is the top goalscorer in our league, and deserves extra credit for doing it without taking penalties, and he is also worthy of selection to Euro 2008"".[5] On 8 July 2008, Güiza joined Turkish club Fenerbahçe SK for €14 million.[9] He managed to score twice in the Süper Lig in his first month, adding another two in the team's run in the UEFA Champions League.[10][11] Güiza ended a long scoring drought on 22 March 2009 with an early goal against Bursaspor, as Fenerbahçe lost 2–1 in the dying minutes of the game. Prior to the beginning of 2009–10 he put three past Budapest Honvéd FC in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League, in a 5–1 home win (6–2 on aggregate),[12] netting his first in the domestic competition in matchday one against Denizlispor, in the first minute of the game.[13] In his first two seasons in Istanbul, Güiza helped the team to consecutive Turkish Cup finals, netting in the 2008–09 edition in a 4–2 loss to Beşiktaş JK.[14] On 18 August 2011, one day after his 31st birthday, Güiza moved to former club Getafe for €6 million,[15] agreeing to a three-year contract shortly after. He was regularly played in the first season in his second spell, starting in 15 of his appearances, but failed to reproduce his previous form and scored just three goals.[16] On 6 November 2012, Güiza signed for Malaysia Super League side Johor Darul Ta'zim F.C. on a season-long loan.[17] His move, along with the acquisition of former S.S. Lazio winger Simone Del Nero and seven Malaysian internationals, was part of the club's major restructuring plans upon the appointment of Tunku Ismail Idris, the Crown Prince of Johor, as president;[18] based on past achievements and honours the player, at the time of his signing, was arguably the most prolific footballer to have competed in the league.[19] Güiza made his first competitive appearance and league debut for his new team on 8 January 2013, in an opening day away game against Pahang FA: despite a 2–3 defeat, he provided the assists for both of his side's goals.[20] He scored his first competitive goal on 15 January in an away game against treble-winners Kelantan FA, with an expertly curled free kick from 25 yards out as the game ended 1–1.[21] Three days later, he netted from open play in a home fixture against 2012 Malaysia Cup runners-up ATM FA, with a volleyed lob from the edge of the penalty area in an eventual 2–2 draw.[22] Güiza played his last match for Johor Darul Takzim on 6 April 2013 in a 2–1 loss against Selangor FA in the FA Cup, after his loan was ended prematurely.[23] Both he and Del Nero left the club.[24][25] In July 2013, Güiza joined Cerro Porteño on loan;[26] his signing was initially criticised by the Paraguayan press.[3] He made his debut on 14 September of that year as a 69th-minute substitute against Sportivo Carapeguá, scoring four minutes later in a 4–0 home win[27] as the team went on to win their 30th Paraguayan Primera División title.[28] Güiza also featured in the following year's Copa Libertadores, netting three times to help to progress from the group stage and leading to interest from other clubs, to which he responded: ""My heart is here, from day one they have shown me affection, my heart is what drives me, so I'm staying here"". However, new manager Leonardo Astrada did not have the player in his plans, which led to his release in March 2015[29] despite having a contract running until June;[30] he also cited the poor health of his father as one of the main reasons for his departure.[31][29] During his spell at the Estadio General Pablo Rojas, Güiza scored 20 goals from 59 competitive appearances.[29] Years after leaving, he was offered a deal at Cerro's rivals Olimpia Asunción, but rejected the offer.[32] In August 2015, Güiza returned to his native Andalusia, signing for Cádiz. His arrival drew the ire of fans, due to disparaging remarks he had made about the club a decade ago while playing for local rivals Xerez.[33] On 26 June 2016, Güiza scored the only goal at Hércules CF in the second leg of the play-off finals (2–0 on aggregate), helping the team return to the second division after six years.[34] On 4 July of the following year, after appearing sparingly during the season, he left.[35] On 10 July 2017, the 37-year-old Güiza signed a two-year contract for Atlético Sanluqueño CF, recently relegated to Tercera División.[36] He achieved promotion to the third tier via the playoffs in his first season,[37] having earlier become one of the few players to score in all of Spain's top four divisions.[38] Güiza remained in Sanlúcar de Barrameda for the ensuing seasons, agreeing to new one-year deals in June 2019[39] and May 2020, while his game time and goals decreased.[40] On 3 January 2021, the 40-year-old scored his first goal of the campaign to secure a 2–1 win at Cádiz CF B, after which he asked for forgiveness from his former club.[41] In August 2022, Güiza left Sanluqueño.[42] Shortly after, he joined amateurs UD Algaida.[43] Güiza signed with Tercera Federación club CD Rota on 19 January 2023.[44] Güiza was a late bloomer on the international stage, having been first called up by Spain on 8 November 2007 (aged 27) for UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers against Sweden and Northern Ireland, as the national team was already qualified for the finals in Austria and Switzerland. He made his international debut against the latter on 21 November, in a 1–0 home win in Las Palmas.[45] Güiza was subsequently selected to the final squad of 23 but, despite being the league's top scorer in that year, still doubted his chances of being picked: ""I was really scared I'd miss out, because being the league's top scorer doesn't guarantee you a place"".[5] On 18 June 2008 he made his debut in the tournament, and scored Spain's winning goal against Greece during the dying moments of the last match group stage match.[46] In the quarter-finals he came on as a substitute against Italy, missing the team's fourth attempt in an eventual penalty shootout win.[47] In the semi-final match against Russia, Güiza netted his second international goal, in a 3–0 win: after receiving a pass from Cesc Fàbregas, he quickly side-flicked it over the goalkeeper.[48] He played 15 minutes in the final against Germany after replacing Fernando Torres (who scored the game's only goal), and came very close to assisting Marcos Senna.[49] On 15 October 2008, Güiza came on as a late substitute against Belgium, and soon after assisted David Villa who scored the winning goal in a close 2–1 contest for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.[50] After an article circulated in January 2009 involving details about personal life and behaviour in training, Güiza's international career future was questioned.[51] Such reports on his behaviour became debatable due to the unreliable sources and any rumours of him being dropped from the Spain team were put to rest when Vicente del Bosque called him up for his services for the 2010 World Cup qualification matches against Turkey, where he solidified his superb performance against Belgium, once again coming on in the dying minutes and assisting a last-minute winner during the match held in Istanbul.[52] On 1 June 2009, Güiza was selected to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.[53] On the 28th he came from the bench as the national team trailed hosts South Africa (0–1) in the third-place match, and responded with a spectacular brace in the last two minutes as Spain eventually won the game in extra-time (3–2).[54] Güiza also played for the Andalusia autonomous team on 27 December 2006, scoring twice in a 3–1 win over a combined Israel–Palestine side at the Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville.[55] Güiza was born to a humble family. He spent his childhood in the working class neighbourhood of La Liberación, in the south side of Jerez de la Frontera.[56] Güiza suffered a divorce from his first wife Rocío with whom he had his first child, which gained a lot of publicity in the Spanish press. Furthermore, he admitted that ""the night confuses me"" and, after joining Getafe, he started to take advantage of the night life in Madrid, suffering a stomach infection as a result and subsequently being forced to go on a diet consisting of liquids alone.[4] During his time at Getafe, Güiza met Nuria Bermúdez. She sat for the qualifications to become an official FIFA football agent, which she passed scoring 29 points, just five below the top and went on to become Güiza's agent.[57] She also obtained the highest score for a female football agent in Spain.[58] Speaking of his relationship with the model, Getafe coach Schuster said: ""Ever since Dani's been with Nuria, he turns up to training and it doesn't look like he's slept under a bridge"". On 1 December 2007, Bermúdez gave birth to Güiza's second son, also named Daniel, at Policlínica Miramar in Palma, Majorca.[59] Before Euro 2008, Güiza promised the media that if he were to win the competition, he would then propose to Bermúdez.[60] In January 2009, the Spanish media began to publicise problems between his family and Bermúdez, with his mother apparently threatening to slit Bermúdez's throat for being a ""thief"".[61] Bermúdez then left Turkey with son Daniel, amongst claims the latter was ignored by the father.[62] Güiza's ex-wife, Rocío Aranda, revealed that the two had met up just hours before the start of the match between England and Spain on 11 February 2009. According to Aranda, they met up in the hotel bar and went on to have sexual intercourse in one of the bedrooms. Subsequently, it was rumoured that Spain coach Del Bosque would drop him from the team.[51] Güiza spoke against this in an interview with Marca saying: ""The truth is, I hadn't seen my son in a while so I went to see him in the hotel, I have to take advantage of such opportunities to see my children. To make money, she [his ex-wife] makes up stories. I spoke with Hierro and I explained the situation. I told him that I had to see my son and I wanted to be with him. I explained everything. I tried my best to be with my son and the truth is the whole story has not come out well in the press.""[63] Fenerbahçe Cerro Porteño Spain Individual","Daniel González Güiza","[""Daniel González

"74532",":Article","  Geoffrey Mujangi Bia (born 12 August 1989) is a Belgian international footballer who plays as a winger for Virton. He established himself in Belgian football with Charleroi before experiencing the English Premier League with a loan spell at Wolverhampton Wanderers. In 2011, he returned to Belgium to join Standard Liège. Mujangi Bia emigrated with his family from DR Congo to Zellik, Belgium as a young child. He began his football career on the books of the Brussels-based club Union Saint-Gilloise, before being spotted by Anderlecht. Although one of their academy's most promising players, he was released by the club.[2] After some months without a club, he joined Charleroi where he made his professional debut on 17 December 2006 in 0–1 defeat at Zulte Waregem, the first of three appearances that season. He scored his first senior goals the following season (3), before 2008–09 saw his most appearances yet as he played 28 league games.[3] The midfielder joined English Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan on 21 January 2010 for the remainder of the 2009–10 season.[4] He made his debut in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace on 23 January 2010.[5] His Premier League debut followed as a substitute in a 2–2 draw at Hull City,[6] one of three league appearances that season. At the season's end it was announced he would also spend the 2010–11 season with Wolves.[7] Mujangi Bia failed to break into Wolves' first team plans during the next season, making just one league appearance, as a late substitute at Manchester City.[8] He scored his only goal for Wolves in a 5–0 FA Cup victory over Championship team Doncaster Rovers.[9] In April 2011 it was announced that he would transfer to Standard Liège on a three-year deal once the transfer window re-opened in the summer.[10] The winger featured for Standard throughout the 2011–12 season as the club ended in fifth place. However, in August 2012, he was told he was no longer involved in the club's plans, and on 25 August signed for English Championship club Watford on a season-long loan deal, having already agreed to a long-term permanent contract; this will commence in summer 2013 if this option is exercised by Watford.[11] He made his Watford debut on 28 August 2012 in their League Cup exit to eventual finalists Bradford.[12] After making two league appearances for Watford in the early part of the season, Bia made his first league appearance since the back end of 2012 as a substitute in a 0–1 defeat to Barnsley on 16 March 2013. During the 2014–15 season Bia scored 14 and created a further 7 goals for Standard Liège. However, after a row with coach Slavoljub Muslin Bia found himself in the B team. During the summer of 2015 a proposed move to Bursaspor fell through after they announced the signing of Hungarian Dzsudzsák. Finally Bia signed a three-year deal with Swiss side Sion. On 10 May 2018, Bia helped Akhisar Belediyespor win their first professional trophy, the 2017–18 Turkish Cup.[13] On 5 February 2018 Bia was fired by his club KSC Lokeren on ""grounds of urgency"".[14] After not playing in 2021, on 28 January 2022 Mujangi Bia joined Virton.[15] Mujangi Bia turned down his birthplace DR Congo to instead represent the Belgium national football team.[17] He made his international debut on 29 May 2009 in a Kirin Cup draw against Chile.[18] He has previously also played for Belgium at under-21 level.","Geoffrey Mujangi Bia","[""Geoffrey Mujangi Bia"",""Charleroi"",""Union Saint-Gilloise"",""winger"",""Belgian"",""Virton"",""football"",""club"",""child"",""loan spell"",""family"",""football career"",""books"",""players"",""Doncaster Rovers."",""Premier League"",""DR Congo"",""winger"",""club"",""English"",""Slavoljub Muslin Bia"",""Wolverhampton Wanderers"",""season"",""season"",""Standard Liège"",""club"",""Zellik"",""Brussels"",""appearances"",""debut"",""first"",""signing"",""one"",""goals"",""season"",""season"",""season"",""season"",""KSC Lokeren"",""league appearance"",""defeat"",""season"",""club"",""club"",""league appearances"",""appearances"",""academy"",""debut"",""club."",""goal"",""substitute"",""one"",""loan"",""FA Cup"",""deal"",""loan deal"",""end"",""team plans"",""draw"",""substitute"",""plans"",""victory"",""remainder"",""row"",""midfielder"",""debut"",""B team"",""place"",""transfer window"",""contract"",""Anderlecht"",""Zulte Waregem"",""goals"",""deal"",""move"",""Standard"",""side"",""trophy"",""debut"",""Watford"",""Championship"",""Manchester City."",""Hull City"",""Crystal Palace"",""DR"",""draw"",""football team."",""season"",""league appearances"",""league games."",""level"",""urgency"",""grounds"",""league appearance"",""debut"",""Bursaspor"",""Hungarian Dzsudzsák"",""Sion"",""Swiss"",""Akhisar Belediyespor"",""Turkish Cup."",""Kirin Cup"",""substitute"",""defeat"",""Chile."",""exit"",""finalists"",""option"",""part"",""birthplace"",""League Cup"",""Bradford."",""Barnsley"",""7"",""28"",""17 December 2006"",""2008"",""21 January 2010"",""2009"",""23 January 2010"",""2010"",""April 2011"",""2011"",""August 2012"",""25 August"",""2013"",""28 August 2012"",""2012"",""16 March 2013"",""2014"",""2015"",""10 May 2018"",""2017"",""5 February 2018"",""2021"",""28 January 2022"",""29 May 2009"",""2"",""2011"",""10"",""12"",""2018"",""0"",""14"",""2010"",""11"",""2009"",""7"",""15"",""12 August 1989"",""13"",""three"",""1"",""2014"",""one"",""2017"",""2008"",""2012"",""1989"",""09"",""16"",""2009"",""one"",""two"",""5"",""0"",""4"",""18"",""three"",""2006"",""2013"",""9"",""2013"",""15"",""2021"",""1"",""2010"",""28"",""10"",""3"",""5"",""25"",""10"",""2022"",""2011"",""three"",""6"",""18"",""8"",""17"",""21"",""11"",""0"",""2"",""28"",""2"",""29"",""one"",""2012"",""2011"",""12"",""2015"",""17"",""21"",""3"",""2010"",""14"",""12"",""2018"",""5"",""2012"",""three"",""23"",""2011""]","0.0035577802949227867","true","[0.69029665,0.021854855,0.018465655,0.01058307,0.0070827575,0.006274469,0.0059981807,0.0052347896,0.0050536864,0.004478491,0.004440558,0.0044284146,0.0044284146,0.00426882,0.004139605,0.0040101917,0.0039614346,0.0033831876,0.0033681681,0.003306331,0.0031238862,0.0030160537,0.0029675988,0.0029619832,0.0027699964,0.0027069917,0.0026271043,0.0026199091,0.00249809,0.0023779965,0.0023779965,0.0022291655,0.0020889149,0.002084959,0.002020109,0.002020109,0.002020109,0.0019986988,0.0019891514,0.001970694,0.0019053471,0.0018534819,0.0018230466,0.0016881261,0.0016822626,0.0016822626,0.0016736417,0.0016013362,0.0016005374,0.0014216317,0.0014065569,0.0014065569,0.0014065569,0.0013548828,0.0013043149,0.001302426,0.0012966384,0.0012966384,0.0012828876,0.0012416717,0.0011879031,0.0011388855,0.001126806,0.0011205558,0.0010994105,0.0010538886,0.0010513967,0.0010448811,0.0010448811,0.0010433675,9.914265E-4,9.892043E-4,9.800885E-4,9.769287E-4,8.969247E-4,8.2787895E-4,7.825703E-4,7.8185665E-4,7.776708E-4,7.7526376E-4,7.662768E-4,7.662768E-4,7.581468E-4,6.658715E-4,6.229335E-4,6.229335E-4,6.1744713E-4,6.114258E-4,5.96452E-4,5.5179675E-4,5.471076E-4,5.471076E-4,5.471076E-4,5.145285E-4,4.897534E-4,4.6285064E-4,4.6285064E-4,4.6239467E-4,4.6239467E-4,4.6197293E-4,4.6197293E-4,4.3344573E-4,4.301328E-4,3.9228552E-4,3.680503E-4,3.445268E-4,3.445268E-4,3.445268E-4,3.445268E-4,2.9558418E-4,2.7294148E-4,2.0353856E-4,2.0353856E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Geoffrey Mujangi Bia - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Mujangi_Bia",,,,,,,
"74533",":Article","  Vicente Guaita Panadero ( Spanish pronunciation: [biˈθente ˈɣwajta panaˈðeɾo];[i] born 10 January 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Celta. He appeared in 176 La Liga matches over eight seasons with Valencia and Getafe, as well as a season on loan with Recreativo in the Segunda División. In 2018, he signed with Crystal Palace, totalling 154 appearances in five years.[3] Born in Torrent, Valencian Community,[4] Guaita graduated from the Valencia youth system after arriving there from CD Monte-sión at the age of 13,[5][4] being promoted to the first team for the 2008–09 season following the retirement of longtime incumbent Santiago Cañizares. Additionally, as German Timo Hildebrand became ostracised by coach Unai Emery, he became the backup.[6][7] Guaita made his official debut with the main squad on 2 October 2008, in a UEFA Cup tie against Marítimo (2–1 home win).[8] However, after the signing of veteran César Sánchez from Tottenham Hotspur later in the year and the full recovery of Renan, he remained third choice until the end of the campaign.[9][10] In 2009–10, with Sánchez having renewed his link a further year and the signing of Mallorca's Miguel Ángel Moyá, Guaita was deemed surplus to requirements and joined, on loan, Segunda División's Recreativo de Huelva.[11] As the Andalusians finished comfortably in mid-table he was awarded the competition's Ricardo Zamora Trophy, with just 24 goals conceded in 30 appearances.[12] In November–December 2010, profiting from injuries to both César and Moyà, Guaita had a run of several matches for Valencia, notably a 2–1 home win against Almería in La Liga[13] and a 1–1 draw away to Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League.[14] On 2 April 2011, as he had established himself in the starting XI, he suffered the loss of his father due to a heart attack (aged only 46),[15] prompting manager Emery to reinstate César between the posts for two games.[16] In May 2011, Guaita extended his contract with Valencia until 2015.[17] He began the season as the starter, but picked up a serious hand injury in early November 2011, being nonetheless selected to several games by Emery as the reserve.[18][19] On 31 July 2014, Guaita was sold to Getafe with a buy-back option.[20] He made his debut for his new team on 24 August, in a 3–1 away loss to Celta.[21] In the 2016–17 campaign, with the club again in the second tier, Guaita played little due to injury.[22][23] He was, however, the starter in the play-offs, which ended in promotion.[24][25][26][27] On 2 February 2018, Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson confirmed Guaita had agreed to join from 1 July on a free transfer.[28] The transfer was reconfirmed by the club on 8 June, with the player agreeing to a three-year contract.[29] He made his Premier League debut on 15 December, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 home win against Leicester City.[30] Guaita eventually became the starter, relegating Wayne Hennessey to the bench.[31] On 1 February 2021, he extended his link until 30 June 2023,[32] and in June was voted his team's player of the season.[33] In January 2023, Guaita signed a new deal until June 2024.[34] However, during that summer, he reportedly refused to play for the side and demanded a transfer, having lost his starting place to Sam Johnstone.[35] He later criticised the club on Twitter after not being included in the squad for Palace's first match of the new season against Sheffield United.[36] On 1 September 2023, aged 36, Guaita returned to his home country and signed a two-year contract with Celta.[37] Getafe Individual","Vicente Guaita","[""Vicente

"74535",":Article","  Rachel Elizabeth Unitt (born 5 June 1982) is a former English footballer who last played for FA Women's Championship club London Bees. After beginning her club career with Wolves, Unitt began a long association with Everton in 2000. This was intersected by a three-year spell at Fulham between 2001 and 2004 and a summer on loan to New Jersey Wildcats in 2005. She left Everton in 2012 for a two-year stint at Birmingham City and later played for Notts County in 2014. A sturdy left back, Unitt has won over 100 caps for the England women's national football team since her debut in August 2000. She represented England at the 2001, 2005 and 2009 editions of the UEFA Women's Championship as well as at the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2007 and 2011. She was ruled out of both the 2013 UEFA Women's Championship and the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics due to injury. In 2004 and 2006 Unitt was named The Football Association's (FA) International Player of the Year. In 2016, she was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame at the National Football Museum.[3] Unitt started her footballing career with Wolves Women as a 14-year-old.[4] She joined Everton Ladies for 2000–01, before signing a professional contract with Fulham L.F.C. the following season. After a successful spell at Fulham, she returned to Everton in 2004. Her achievements to date include winning the domestic treble with Fulham in the 2002–03 season and the 2010 FA Women's Cup with Everton. In July 2005, Unitt joined American W-League side New Jersey Wildcats for the last seven games of their season, teaming up with England and former Fulham teammate Rachel Yankey. The Wildcats eventually won the W-League championship, beating the Ottawa Fury by 3–0 in the championship match with Unitt scoring the first goal. Unitt also trained with Malmö FF in December 2005, but, fearing burn-out, rejected a contract offer from the Swedish club.[5] With Everton dormant ahead of the 2011 FA WSL season, Unitt played for Leeds City Vixens in the FA Women's Premier League Cup.[6] At the end of the 2011 FA WSL season, Unitt put in a transfer request after eight years at Everton.[7] Following negotiations a move to Birmingham City was announced in February 2012.[8] After her time at the club was disrupted by injury, Unitt rejected Birmingham's offer of a contract extension in January 2014 and left the club as a free agent.[9] She signed for Notts County on 30 January 2014,[10] only to suffer an injury to the cruciate ligament in her other knee during the 2014 FA WSL season.[11] In December 2014 she agreed to stay with Notts County, combining her rehabilitation with a place on the club's coaching staff.[12] In 2016, Unitt played for Solihull Moors L.F.C., a women's football club in the West Midlands, which at the time was in the FA Women's Premier League.[13] Unitt first played for England in 2000, after 16 appearances for the U18s. Her senior debut came in August 2000, in a 1–0 friendly defeat to France, before 50,000 spectators at Stade Vélodrome.[14][15] She scored her first international goal in England's victory over the Netherlands in September 2004,[16] and scored twice more in her home town of Walsall during England's 4–1 friendly win over the Czech Republic in May 2005.[17] Unitt was named the Nationwide International Player of the Year at the 2004 The FA Women's Football Awards. She won the same award in 2006, voted for by the fans on the FA website.[18] In May 2009, Unitt was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.[19] At the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China, Unitt was the only outfield member of the England squad who remained unused. On the occasion of her 90th cap, she eventually made a World Cup debut in June 2011, starting England's 1–1 draw with Mexico in Wolfsburg.[20] In March 2012 a Euro 2013 qualifier in Croatia saw Unitt win her 100th international cap. Captain for the day, Unitt scored England's third goal in a 6–0 victory, with a diving header.[21] A foot injury kept Unitt out of contention for a place in the Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. During her absence Steph Houghton became the first choice left–back for the national team.[22] In May 2013 Unitt suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Birmingham's 1–1 FA WSL Cup draw with Lincoln, which ruled her out of UEFA Women's Euro 2013.[23] She was allotted 135 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[24][25] After retiring as a player, Unitt became a firefighter in Stoke-on-Trent.[26]","Rachel Unitt","[""Rachel Elizabeth Unitt"",""London Bees"",""New Jersey

"74537",":Article","  Fara Tanya Franki Merrett MBE (born 25 January 1984), known professionally as Fara Williams, is a former English footballer who played as a central midfielder for multiple clubs, as well as the England national team.[4] A consistent goalscorer and set-piece specialist, Williams was considered one of England's leading players.[5][6] From her senior debut in 2001 until her retirement in 2019, Williams earned 177 caps for the England women's team, making her their highest capped player. She played at the 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2017 European Championships, as well as the World Cups in 2007, 2011 and 2015. Williams also featured for Team GB at the 2012 London Olympics. Williams' club career started with Chelsea then she progressed to Charlton Athletic in 2001. She signed for Everton in 2004 and later became the captain of the club, winning the Premier League Cup in 2008 and the FA Women's Cup in 2010. After eight years with Everton she signed for local rivals Liverpool in 2012 and won the league title in 2013 and 2014. Williams was named The Football Association (FA) Young Player of the Year in 2002, FA Players' Player of the Year in 2009 and FA International Player of the Year in both 2007 and 2009. Williams attended Shene School in Richmond, London and joined Chelsea under–14s at the age of 12.[7] She scored 30 goals for Chelsea's first team in 2000–01 and signed for Charlton Athletic Ladies during the following season. She won Charlton's Player of the Year and the FA Women's Young Player of the Year in her first season, 2001–02.[8] A back injury ruled Williams out of much of the 2002–03 season.[9] In May 2003 Williams scored an unfortunate own goal three minutes after coming on as a substitute in Charlton's 3–0 FA Women's Cup final defeat to Fulham.[10] She headed a corner from Fulham's Rachel Unitt – Williams' England teammate and then flatmate[11] – into her own net.[12] In 2003–04 Williams returned to form and was an important part of the Charlton Athletic side who challenged for all three domestic trophies.[13] She started Charlton's second successive FA Women's Cup final in May 2004, but suffered another 3–0 defeat as Julie Fleeting scored a hat-trick for Arsenal.[14] Although Arsenal also pipped Charlton to the League title by a single point,[15] Williams collected an FA Women's Premier League Cup winners' medal when Charlton beat Fulham 1–0 at Underhill in March 2004.[16] Williams surprisingly moved to Everton Ladies in summer 2004,[17] where fans gave her the nickname ""Queen Fara"".[18] In 2004–05 Williams lost her third FA Women's Cup final in a row, to former club Charlton.[19] She won another League Cup medal in 2007–08 as Everton defeated Arsenal at Brisbane Road.[20] Williams missed two penalties, one in normal time and one in the shoot-out, as Everton were edged out by Leeds in the FA Women's Cup semi-final at Haig Avenue.[21] In 2008–09 Everton missed out on the League title on goal difference after a final day defeat to Arsenal. However, Williams' performances saw her voted FA Players' Player of the Year.[22] On 23 September 2009 Williams was picked in the Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) International Draft by Philadelphia Independence. She was due to join up with her England teammate Lianne Sanderson in America, before deciding to stay with Everton.[23] Williams' loyalty was rewarded with another two Cup finals in 2010: a defeat to Leeds Carnegie in the Premier League Cup, in which Williams scored Everton's consolation,[24] followed by a memorable extra–time win over Arsenal in the FA Women's Cup.[25] In November 2012 Williams and Natasha Dowie left Everton for local rivals Liverpool, who were hoping to build a squad capable of ending Arsenal's dominance of English women's football.[26] Liverpool beat Bristol Academy 2–0 on the final day to secure the 2013 FA WSL league title.[27] Liverpool retained their title in 2014, but were much less successful in 2015. They finished seventh of eight teams as Williams missed three months of the season with a hamstring injury[28] and coach Matt Beard departed for American National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) club Boston Breakers.[29] On 5 January 2016, Liverpool confirmed that Williams would be leaving the club to sign for deposed former champions Arsenal Ladies. Williams said: ""I have really enjoyed my time at Liverpool Ladies and will take away some absolutely fantastic memories. When I first joined the Club the team had finished bottom of the league so to win back to back league titles was an incredible achievement."" [30] On 16 August 2017, she left Arsenal Women to join Women's Super League (WSL) rivals Reading on a two-year deal.[31] In May 2019, she signed a new contract with Reading.[32] On 26 April 2021, Williams announced that she would be retiring from the game at the end of the 2020–21 season.[33] Williams' senior England debut came aged 17 against Portugal in November 2001.[34] During the return fixture in February 2002, her first start, Williams scored the opening goal from a free kick in a 3–0 win at Fratton Park.[35] Williams played in all three of England's group games at Women's Euro 2005, scoring a penalty in the 2–1 defeat to Denmark. She also scored five goals in helping England qualify for the World Cup in China, including two in the 13–0 win over Hungary. Williams forced the decisive own-goal in the play-off against France which sealed qualification.[36] She went on to play in all three of England's group games at the World Cup, and scored a penalty in England's 6–1 win over Argentina. However, she also picked up her second yellow card of the group stage in that match, and so missed the quarter-final defeat by the United States through suspension.[37] On 23 May, Williams picked up the 2007 FA International Player of the Year Award.[36] On 8 May 2008 England played Belarus in the UEFA Women's Euro 2009 qualifying and Williams scored a hat-trick of long-range goals.[38] In May 2009 Williams was again named FA International Player of the Year, and was also voted FA Players' Player of the Year.[39] At the Euro 2009 final tournament in Finland, Williams scored a penalty during England's first game against Italy. However, England lost the match 2–1 after Williams' error resulted in a red card for Casey Stoney.[40] England improved and Williams, captain in the absence of the injured Faye White, scored in a 3–2 quarter final win over hosts Finland.[41] She also featured in the semi-final win over the Netherlands and 6–2 final defeat by Germany.[22] Williams was England's top-scorer with seven goals during qualifying for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.[42] A knee injury sustained in a WSL match with Lincoln Ladies left her battling for fitness ahead of the finals.[43] Despite this, Williams was ""more than pleased"" to be named in the squad on 10 June 2011.[44] At the final tournament, she headed the first goal of England's campaign in the 1–1 draw with Mexico and also featured against New Zealand before being rested for the final group game, a 2–0 victory over Japan. Williams played 120 minutes in the quarter-final exit to France. She was not among the penalty takers in England's penalty shootout defeat. Williams earned her 100th cap at the 2012 Cyprus Cup against Switzerland on 1 March 2012. England won the game 1–0 with Williams proud to score the only goal of the game: ""It's a massive achievement to reach 100 caps and getting the goal made it extra special.""[45] She was part of the England squad which performed poorly at UEFA Women's Euro 2013 and was eliminated in the first round. On 3 August 2014, Williams led the England team out against Sweden and became the most capped player in the history of English football, with 130 Caps. England won the match 4–0 in Hartlepool.[46] At the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, Williams scored a 38th-minute penalty kick against Colombia, as England won 2–1 in Montreal on 17 June. In the semi-final in Edmonton on 2 July, Williams converted her second penalty of the tournament, in the 40th minute, to give England an equaliser against defending champions Japan. England lost the game 2–1. Two days later, and back in Edmonton, Williams scored another penalty, on this occasion in extra time, to give England the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Germany. Her crucial goal gave England their first ever win over Germany and secured a bronze medal, the team's best ever finish at the FIFA Women's World Cup.[47] Williams was not included in England's squad for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, but manager Phil Neville said her international career was not over.[48] She was allotted 140 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[49][50] In June 2012, Williams was named in an 18-player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics.[52] Williams was homeless for six years during the early part of her football career.[53] She was later employed by FA as a skills coach.[23] She has worked for the Homeless FA charity as a coach at Manchester United's The Cliff, and helping to select the England team for the Homeless World Cup.[54] Williams was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)[55] in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to women's football and charity.[56] She supports Chelsea F.C.[57][58] In December 2015, she married former Everton teammate Amy Kane, but they separated a short time later.[59] Everton Liverpool Arsenal England

"74538",":Article","  Francesco Totti Ufficiale OMRI[3][4] ( Italian pronunciation: [franˈtʃesko ˈtɔtti];[5][6] born 27 September 1976) is an Italian former professional footballer who played solely for Roma and the Italy national team. He was a creative offensive playmaker who could play as an attacking midfielder and as a forward (second striker, lone striker, or winger), Totti spent his entire career at Roma, winning a Serie A title, two Coppa Italia titles, and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. He is the second-highest scorer of all time in Italian league history with 250 goals, and is the sixth-highest scoring Italian in all competitions with 316 goals.[7] Totti is the top goalscorer and the most capped player in Roma's history, holds the record for the most goals scored in Serie A while playing for a single club, and also holds the record for the youngest club captain in the history of Serie A. In November 2014, Totti extended his record as the oldest goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history, aged 38 years and 59 days. During his career at Roma, Totti has been referred to as Er Bimbo de Oro (The Golden Boy), Er Pupone (The Big Baby), L'Ottavo Re di Roma (The Eighth King of Rome), and Il Capitano (The Captain) by the Italian sports media. A 2006 FIFA World Cup winner and UEFA Euro 2000 finalist with Italy, Totti was selected in the All-Star team for both tournaments; he also represented his country at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. In 2007, Totti announced his international retirement due to recurring physical problems[8] and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma.[9] Totti won a record eleven Oscar del Calcio awards from the Italian Footballers' Association: five Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Goal of the Year awards, one Serie A Goalscorer of the Year award, and one Serie A Young Footballer of the Year award. He also won the 2007 European Golden Shoe and the 2010 Golden Foot. Totti was selected in the European Sports Media team of the season three times. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world's greatest living players as selected by Pelé, as part of FIFA's centenary celebrations.[10] In 2011, Totti was recognised by IFFHS as the most popular footballer in Europe.[11] In 2015, France Football rated him as one of the ten-best footballers in the world who are over age 36.[12] Following his retirement in 2017, Totti was awarded the Player's Career Award and the UEFA President's Award. Totti was born in Rome to parents Lorenzo and Fiorella Totti. He was raised in the Porta Metronia neighbourhood.[13] As a youngster he idolised ex-Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini,[14] and regularly played football with older boys.[15] Totti began to play youth team football in 1984, with Fortitudo, later joining Trastevere and Lodigiani. After he came to the attention of scouts, his mother refused a lucrative offer from Milan in order to keep him in his home town. Although his youth club initially had come to an agreement to sell Totti to the Lazio youth side, one of Roma's youth coaches, Gildo Giannini, persuaded his parents to let him join the Roma youth squad in 1989.[13] After three years in the youth team, Totti made his first appearance for Roma's senior side in Serie A at the age of 16, when coach Vujadin Boškov called him up in the 2–0 away victory against Brescia on 28 March 1993.[16] In the following season under Carlo Mazzone, Totti began to play more regularly as a second striker,[17] and scored his first goal on 4 September 1994 in a 1–1 draw against Foggia.[15][18] By 1995, Totti had become a regular in Roma's starting line-up and scored 16 goals during the next three seasons, while creating several more, as his talent was praised by his manager Mazzone.[17][19] Following Mazzone's sacking in the summer of 1996 and the departure of Giannini, Totti was expected to play a more prominent role, after several promising seasons; however, the team underperformed during the 1996–97 season, while Totti struggled to gain playing time under new manager Carlos Bianchi, and was even set to leave for Sampdoria on loan in January 1997. Roma's chairman at the time however, Franco Sensi, impeded the transfer, leading to further tensions with the manager, who eventually parted ways with the club.[15][20] Totti's years under Zdeněk Zeman represented a period of both physical and mental maturation as a player. From a technical and tactical standpoint, he proved to be compatible on the left wing in the rigid formations of the Bohemian coach, as his new role gave him more space to take on defenders in one on one situations, and cut into the centre to shoot on goal with his stronger foot;[15][17] he also became physically more powerful, fit, hard-working, and complete.[21] He displayed a greater responsibility for the team, and was presented with the number 10 jersey.[15][22] His first season under Zeman started well, with Totti taking advantage of a 4–3–3 formation and making his breakthrough with the club.[23] He finished the league season reaching double figures in goals scored for the first time in his career;[20] including a goal in the club's 2–0 away win against Napoli on 22 February 1998,[24] Totti scored 13 goals in Serie A in total,[25] and contributed to Roma's fourth place league finish that year.[26] Although he was not called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup by Italy manager Cesare Maldini,[27] his consistent performances, creativity and goalscoring throughout the course of the previous Serie A season saw him being awarded the Guerin d'Oro for the 1997–98 season, given to him for having achieved the highest average rating of any Serie A player.[28] The following season, he began to gain recognition as a club symbol and as a leader,[15] and on 31 October 1998, Totti became the official team captain, and the youngest Serie A club captain ever at the age of 22, inheriting the armband from Aldair.[29] On 29 November 1998, Totti scored the equalising goal in a 3–3 draw against cross-city rivals Lazio; this was his first ever goal in the Rome Derby.[15][30] Overall, he scored 30 goals and provided 26 assists during Zeman's two-year managerial stint.[15] For his performances, he was named the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year for the 1998–99 season.[1] In June 1999, Roma's then-president Franco Sensi sacked Zeman and signed Fabio Capello as a replacement, with the aim of winning the league title.[31] By the 2000–01 campaign under the new coach, Roma were building a competitive team around Totti, who was by now being utilised as a creative attacking midfielder by Capello in a 3–4–1–2 formation, due to his passing skills and playmaking abilities.[32][33][34] Totti scored in a 2–0 home win over Bologna on his season debut on 1 October 2000.[35] On 10 December, Totti scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 home win against Udinese, with a powerful left-footed volley to help Roma to their fifth home win of the season.[36] He continued his goalscoring form by scoring against Napoli at home in a 3–0 victory on 28 January 2001, as Roma finished the first half of the league season in first place.[37][38] Totti continued to play an important role in keeping the club at the top of the table throughout the remainder of the season, gaining a comfortable lead over rivals Juventus.[39] On 17 June 2001, at the Stadio Olimpico, Roma beat Parma 3–1, with their three main attackers, Totti, Vincenzo Montella and Gabriel Batistuta scoring one goal each, as Roma were crowned champions of Italy for the third time in their history.[40] Totti finished the league season with 13 goals, equalling what was at the time his personal goalscoring record in a single Serie A season.[15] On 19 August 2001, Totti won his first Supercoppa Italiana, scoring and assisting in the 3–0 win against Fiorentina.[41] Totti was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for both 2000 and 2001,[42][43] and won the Serie A Footballer of the Year Award for the first time in his career in 2000.[28] He received his first Ballon d'Or nomination in 2000, finishing 14th in voting, and fifth the following year.[44] Due to his performances and leadership, Totti had established himself as a hero to the Roma fans, who were also able to identify with his background as a Rome native and lifelong supporter.[15] Over the following seasons, Totti played in a free role as either a forward or second striker in a 3–5–2 formation, often alongside either Batistuta or the newly acquired youngster Antonio Cassano.[17] He scored his first hat-trick in Serie A, in a 3–2 away win over Brescia on 30 September 2002.[45] Totti also scored the only goal in Roma's decisive 1–0 victory at the Santiago Bernabéu against Real Madrid on 30 October 2002; this was the first time in 35 years that an Italian team had won a match in Madrid.[46] He continued his goalscoring exploits against Valencia, scoring two goals in a 3–0 win.[47] Despite this, Roma only finished third in their Champions League group, and in eighth position in Serie A,[48] although they managed to reach the 2003 Coppa Italia final. In the final against Milan, Totti scored three times from free kicks over both legs (one goal at home and two at the San Siro), but Roma lost out to Milan 6–3 on aggregate.[49] In 2003, Totti won his second Serie A Footballer of the Year Award.[28] In the 2003–04 season, Totti played a key role, as Roma finished runner-up to Milan in the Scudetto race.[50] Throughout the league season, he scored 20 goals, his best haul in Serie A up to that point, which allowed him to win his second Guerin d'Oro, as the player with the best average rating in Serie A throughout the season.[28] Moreover, the Roma captain notably scored trademark chipped goals on two occasions throughout the season, against Brescia and Empoli.[51] Despite Roma's disappointing 2004–05 season, which saw the departure of a number of players and several managerial changes,[52][53] Totti maintained consistent form by scoring twelve goals in Serie A,[2] and 15 in all competitions, among which was his 100th Serie A goal from a free kick in a 3–3 draw against Inter Milan, on 3 October 2004.[54] Two months later, on 19 December, he became Roma's all-time leading scorer in Serie A after netting his 107th career league goal against Parma, breaking the record previously held by Roberto Pruzzo.[55] Although Roma finished the league season in eighth place,[56] Totti helped the team reach the 2005 Coppa Italia final; however Roma lost to Inter.[57] Roma's new coach for the 2005–06 season, Luciano Spalletti, went with a 4–2–3–1 formation, deploying Totti in a newer, more offensive role as a lone striker.[17] Despite his new attacking role, Totti usually dropped deep to pick up the ball in midfield rather than operating in the penalty area, thus creating space for the attacking midfielders and wingers to making offensive runs; the resulting system was later described as a 4–6–0, while Totti's particular attacking role was dubbed the ""false 9"".[15][58] In this new position, Totti continued to score frequently, managing 15 goals in 24 league matches. In the spring of 2005, he renewed his contract until 2010, with an annual salary of €5.4 million.[59] On 19 February 2006, he suffered a fracture of his left fibula and ligament damage during a match against Empoli, after being fouled by Richard Vanigli.[60] Totti was at risk of missing the 2006 World Cup, but returned to the side on 11 May 2006 as a substitute in Roma's 3–1 Coppa Italia final defeat to Inter.[61] A metal plate had been attached to his ankle during surgery, but doctors decided not to operate again and remove it following Totti's return, concurring that the plate would not affect his game.[62] He was given off-label treatments of teriparatide to speed-up his fracture recovery.[63] The 2006–07 season was a personal high for Totti, as he scored 26 goals in Serie A, as well as another six between the Champions League (scoring three times in the group stage and once in the round of 16 tie against Lyon) and the Coppa Italia, in addition to 15 assists in 50 games across all competitions.[15] Despite their elimination from the Champions League by Manchester United in the quarter-finals, and a second-place finish in the league, Roma won the Coppa Italia final against league champions Inter with a 6–2 victory at home (Totti scored the opening goal after 50 seconds) and a 2–1 defeat at the San Siro in Milan.[15][64] Totti finished the season as Serie A top scorer with 26 goals,[65] and on 17 June, he also received the ESM European Golden Shoe award as the top European goalscorer of the season.[66] Despite being the highest active goalscorer in Serie A, he was not among the finalists for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year[67] due to his absence from the national team, although he was nominated for the 2007 Ballon d'Or, finishing tenth in the voting.[68] On 19 August 2007, Totti contributed to Roma's 1–0 victory over Inter in the 2007 Supercoppa Italiana, winning a penalty which was subsequently converted by Daniele De Rossi.[69] Totti scored his 200th goal for Roma in a 4–0 victory against Torino in the Coppa Italia, on 16 January 2008.[70] He was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for the fifth time in his career on 28 January.[43] The following month, on 24 February, he reached 386 appearances in Serie A with Roma in a match against Fiorentina, equalling the club appearance record previously held by Giacomo Losi, Roma's captain in the 1960s. He broke the record on 27 February, in the club's following league match against Inter.[71][72] On 9 March, he reached his 500th overall appearance for Roma, scoring the second goal of the match from a penalty kick in a 2–0 away win over Napoli.[73] Totti suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee during a 1–1 draw with Livorno on 19 April. Tests revealed a tear of his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that required surgery, ruling him out for four months.[74] Roma won their ninth Coppa Italia with a 2–1 victory over Inter on 24 May; although Totti did not play the match, he was still allowed to lift the cup as the team's captain.[75][76] With this win, Totti became the most successful captain in the club's history, with five titles and ten runners-up medals.[77] In the 2008–09 season, Totti recovered from the previous injury, and took part in the 2008 Supercoppa Italiana final on 24 August 2008; following a 2–2 draw with Inter after extra-time, Totti missed his penalty in the resulting shootout, which allowed Javier Zanetti to win the match for Inter with the following spot-kick.[78] On 8 November 2008, he made his 400th appearance in Serie A, in a 1–1 away draw against Bologna, scoring the opening goal of the match.[79] Later that month, he went on to help his team beat Lazio in the Rome derby, assisting Júlio Baptista's match-winning goal.[80] Totti's run of good form continued as he provided assists for Mirko Vučinić, and scored a lobbed goal in a 3–0 win in a league game against Lecce on 23 November,[81] while he netted a free kick in a 3–1 away win against CFR Cluj in the Champions League later that week, on 27 November.[82] He also scored the second goal in a 2–0 win against Bordeaux on 10 December, which ensured Roma's passage to the round of 16 of the competition as group winners.[83] On 19 April 2009, Totti scored his 175th Serie A goal in a 3–2 home win over Lecce, overtaking Amedeo Amadei as Roma's all-time highest goalscorer; with the goal, Totti also became one of the top-ten goalscorers in Serie A history.[84] Roma's difficult start to the 2008–09 season and continued struggles at the start of the 2009–10 season saw Spalletti resign after a four-year reign, and he was replaced by Claudio Ranieri.[85] Totti performed well in the inaugural UEFA Europa League; he scored two hat-tricks in the competition that season, first in a 7–1 away win against Gent in the third qualifying round[86] and then another in the same scoreline against MFK Košice at the Stadio Olimpico in the play-off round.[87] In Serie A, he also scored three goals against Bari on 22 November 2009, seven years on from his last hat-trick in Serie A.[88][89][90] Eight days later, Totti confirmed he had signed a new five-year playing contract, which would see him stay at the club until 2014, after which he stated he would become a club director for a further five years.[91][92] Roma offered him an annual salary of €8.9 million for 2009–10 and €8.6 million a year for the next four seasons.[93] With a 24-match unbeaten run in Serie A, Roma became the only challengers to Inter in the last three rounds for the league title that season,[94] ultimately finishing runners-up after the final game.[95] Despite suffering several injury problems,[96] he surpassed former prolific strikers such as Gabriel Batistuta,[97] Giuseppe Signori,[98] and Kurt Hamrin,[99] putting him in sixth place in the all-time Serie A scoring records.[100] Totti also played in the Coppa Italia final against Inter on 5 May 2010, but received a red card in the closing minutes of the second half for kicking Mario Balotelli; Roma lost the match 0–1, thus failing to bring home a record tenth Coppa Italia title.[101] In the 2010–11 season, Roma suffered yet another defeat to Inter in the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana,[102] continuing their ""traditional"" early struggles, which Totti partly blamed on Ranieri's defensive mindset and failure to develop a consistent set of tactics.[103][104][105] On a personal level, Totti won the Golden Foot award,[106] but Ranieri's lack of faith in him due to his age meant that the captain would spend a lot of time on the substitute's bench in favour of younger forwards, such as Marco Borriello, Mirko Vučinić and Jérémy Ménez.[107][108] His limited playing time, which included a controversial 91st minute substitution in a 2–1 away loss against Sampdoria,[109] resulted in several clashes with Ranieri, and saw him fall out of form, scoring only three league goals in 21 appearances;[110] as a result of his limited appearances, despondence and strenuous relationship with the manager, rumours even circulated in the media that Totti was considering leaving Roma.[111] Following Roma's 4–3 loss against Genoa on 20 February 2011, Ranieri resigned as manager, with Totti's former teammate Vincenzo Montella appointed as caretaker coach.[112] Montella reverted to Spalletti's 4–2–3–1 system and Totti appeared to recapture his best form, finding the net more frequently towards the end of the season.[113][114] On 3 March, Totti was voted the best active Italian player in a poll conducted by La Gazzetta dello Sport; 100 Italian personalities including footballers, politicians and celebrities took part in the vote. On 13 March 2011, he scored two goals against Lazio which gave Roma their fifth consecutive victory in the Rome derby.[115] The following match, on 20 March, Totti became the sixth player in Serie A history to score 200 goals, finding the target twice in a 2–2 draw against Fiorentina to total 201 league goals.[116] On 1 May, Totti scored a brace against Bari to equal and subsequently overtake Roberto Baggio as the fifth-highest goalscorer in Serie A with his 205th and 206th career league goals, putting him behind only Silvio Piola, Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza and José Altafini.[117] Totti ended the 2010–11 Serie A campaign with 15 goals – with twelve of his goals coming in Roma's last 13 league fixtures.[114] At the end of the season, Roma underwent a change of ownership, with the former club owner Rosella Sensi being replaced by an American consortium led by Thomas DiBenedetto.[118] Under the new management, the club did not offer a permanent contract to Montella, which led to him leaving to coach another Serie A side, Catania.[119] The new management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona's football style.[120] The 2011–12 season saw Totti initially receive few starts under Roma's new manager Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued.[121] Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 in the second half of a match against Atalanta, which kept him out of action until 20 November;[122] he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the bench in the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.[123] In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, he started playing more regularly, often in a creative role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi's opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match.[124] He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo's goal in Roma's 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011,[125] and also set up De Rossi's goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium.[126] Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.[15][127][128][129] On 8 January 2012, Totti scored his first goals of the season in a 2–0 win against Chievo, converting one penalty in the first half and another in the second.[130] He went on to score two goals in a 5–1 win against Cesena which allowed Totti to set a new record, as his second goal of the match brought his tally to 211 league goals – the most any player has ever scored for a single club in Serie A.[131] Despite his inability to find the back of the net as the second half of the season began, he continued to perform well, as he notably assisted Juan's goal from a corner in Roma's 4–0 win over Inter on 5 February.[132] On 12 April, Totti scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3–1 victory over Udinese.[133] He scored again in a 2–1 loss against Fiorentina on 25 April,[134] and two weeks later, on his 500th match in Serie A, he scored two goals in a 2–2 draw against Catania at the Stadio Olimpico.[135] After Luis Enrique decided to resign due to an unsuccessful season in which Roma failed to qualify for European football for the first time in 15 years, the club decided to appoint their former manager Zdeněk Zeman, with whom Totti would once again be reunited. Zeman tried to play Totti in a free role as a left forward or winger in his preferred 4–3–3 tactical line-up.[136] Although this was a similar role to that which he had played during Zeman's previous spell 13 years before, Totti's freedom also enabled him to drop deep into the midfield to press opponents and pick up the ball, as well as attacking on the left wing.[137] On 2 September, Totti provided 2 assists for Alessandro Florenzi and Dani Osvaldo in Roma's 3–1 win over Inter at the San Siro. After the match, he received praise from the media due to his performance, even as he approached his 36th birthday.[138] On 21 October, Totti surpassed both Giuseppe Meazza and José Altafini's joint-record after scoring the first of Roma's goals in a 4–2 away win at Genoa, becoming the third-highest scorer in Serie A history with 217 goals.[139] On 8 December, Totti scored two goals, his fifth and sixth of the season, in a 4–2 home victory against Fiorentina.[140] Following the club's negative performances, Zeman was sacked and replaced by the club's technique coach Aurelio Andreazzoli in early February 2013.[141][142] Under his new manager, Totti scored a goal against Juventus on 16 February, with a powerful strike, as Roma shocked the league leaders in a 1–0 win.[143] On 3 March, he scored his 225th goal against Genoa to become Serie A's joint second-top scorer – alongside Gunnar Nordahl – as Roma cruised to a 3–1 victory.[144] Totti finally broke Nordahl's record by scoring against Parma on 18 March, increasing his Serie A tally to 226 goals.[145] On 8 April, with a goal from a penalty kick in the 1–1 draw against Lazio, he became the joint top scorer of all time in Serie A in the Rome Derby with nine goals, putting him on par with Dino da Costa and Marco Delvecchio.[146] Totti finished the 2012–13 Serie A season with 12 goals and 12 assists from 34 appearances.[147] Totti also reached the 2013 Coppa Italia final with Roma, but lost the match 0–1 on 26 May to cross-city rivals Lazio.[148] With the arrival of Roma's new coach Rudi Garcia in the summer of 2013, Totti was once again deployed as a false 9, while also functioning as a supporting forward, or as winger on the left on occasion.[15] On 20 September 2013, Roma announced that Totti had signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2016, past his 39th birthday.[149] He scored his first goal of the 2013–14 season on 16 September, against Parma in a 3–1 victory.[150] He followed up the goal with two strikes in Roma's 3–0 away victory over Inter, helping the team maintain a 100% record after seven games.[151] On 20 November, he received the ""Captain of Captains"" award by the association Editutto and Baker Tilly Revisa.[152] On 14 February, Totti was sidelined for about a month after sustaining a bruised right buttock.[153] He returned to the pitch on 17 March against Udinese, scoring the first goal of the match as he helped his team to a 3–2 win.[154] Eight days later, Totti celebrated 700 overall appearances with Roma against Torino.[155] On 2 April, he scored his 20th career goal against Parma (a personal record against any side) in a 4–2 victory.[156] He finished the season with eight goals and ten assists, ending the year as the top assist provider of the 2013–14 Serie A season.[157] Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Totti had been one of the star players of Roma's pre-season friendlies.[158] On 30 September 2014, three days after his 38th birthday, Totti scored Roma's equaliser in a Champions League group stage draw at Manchester City, thus becoming the oldest scorer in the UEFA Champions League era;[159] before Pepe broke his record in 2023.[160] It was also Totti's 300th professional career goal.[161][162] On 25 October, Totti scored the opening goal from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against CSKA Moscow, extending his record of being the oldest goalscorer in the history of the competition to 38 years and 59 days.[163] On 11 January 2015, Totti scored two goals against local rivals Lazio, making him the joint all-time top scorer in the Rome derby in official club competitions, alongside Dino Da Costa, with eleven goals, as well as the Serie A top scorer in the Rome derby.[164][165] On 9 May, Totti scored from a penalty in a 2–1 away defeat to Milan, equalling Roberto Baggio for the record of the most goals scored in Serie A from penalties (68).[166][167] On 31 May, in the final match-day of the 2014–15 season, he scored his 299th goal for Roma in a 2–1 home defeat to Palermo.[168] Totti finished the season as Roma's leading scorer with ten goals in all competitions, the seventh time in which he had been the team's top scorer.[169] On his second league appearance of the 2015–16 Serie A season, Totti scored his 300th career club goal in all competitions with Roma in a 2–2 home draw with Sassuolo, on 20 September 2015.[170] On 26 September 2015, the day before his 39th birthday, he sustained an injury, straining his right hip flexor in a 5–1 win over Carpi, ruling him out for three months.[171] He returned to the pitch as a substitute in a 1–1 home draw against Milan, on 9 January 2016,[172] equalling Gianluca Pagliuca as the third all-time highest appearance holder in Serie A history, with 592 appearances.[173] On 21 February 2016, Totti publicly criticised returning manager – and Rudi Garcia's replacement – Luciano Spalletti in the media for his lack of playing time since his return from injury. He was subsequently dropped for Roma's 5–0 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media,[174] while rumours once again began to circulate that Totti would be leaving the club once his contract had expired at the end of the season, as a result of his limited appearances and clashes with Spalletti.[175] On 8 March, Totti came on as a substitute for Stephan El Shaarawy in the return leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid, and was given a standing ovation by the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid; Roma lost the match 2–0, however, and were eliminated from the competition following a 4–0 aggregate loss.[176] On 20 April, he came off the bench in the 86th minute, one goal down to Torino at home to rescue the team with a brace; one in the 87th minute and a penalty in the 89th minute to win the match 3–2.[177] With his 69th goal in Serie A from the penalty spot, he overtook Roberto Baggio as the outright top scorer of penalties in Serie A history.[178] Totti's double also made him the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days, breaking Silvio Piola's previous record of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, which he had managed with Novara on 1 February 1953, after scoring a brace against his former team Lazio.[179] On 2 May, Totti came off the bench and scored from a free kick to help Roma to come from behind and achieve a 3–2 away win over Genoa; this was his 21st goal from a free kick in Serie A, which put him alongside Baggio as the joint all-time fourth-highest scorer of free kicks in Serie A history, behind only Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo, and Siniša Mihajlović. Totti came off the bench in each of the past five Serie A games and contributed four goals and an assist.[180][181] On 8 May, Totti came off the bench to set up Roma's final goal in a 3–0 home win over Chievo in his 600th Serie A appearance, becoming the third player ever to reach this milestone.[182][183] Overall, Totti only made 13 league appearances throughout the season but scored four goals in the final six matches as a substitute.[184] On 7 June, he renewed his contract for another year, stating that he would be retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season;[184][185] he also revealed he had signed a six-year contract to become Roma's technical director once the season ended.[186] On his first appearance of the 2016–17 season against Sampdoria on 11 September, Totti equalled Paolo Maldini's record of playing in 25 Serie A seasons. With Roma trailing 2–1 at half time, Totti came off the bench and assisted Edin Džeko's temporary equaliser, later also scoring the match-winning goal from a penalty in injury time to secure a 3–2 home win in Serie A; Totti's goal meant that he had managed to score at least once in each of the past 23 consecutive seasons of his career.[187] On 25 September, he scored his 250th Serie A goal from the penalty spot in a 3–1 away defeat to Torino, just two days before his 40th birthday.[188] On his first start two days after his 40th birthday, on 29 September, Totti was praised for his performance and longevity in a 4–0 home win over Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League; he played all 90 minutes of the match, providing two assists, while also being involved in a third goal.[189] On 20 October, Totti made his 100th appearance in UEFA club competitions, setting up two goals in a 3–3 home draw against Austria Wien in the Europa League.[190] In late October, he sustained a muscle injury to the flexor of his left thigh during a training session, which ruled him out indefinitely.[191] He returned to action as a substitute in a 3–2 home win over Pescara on 27 November.[192] On 1 February 2017, Totti scored a decisive injury-time penalty in the 97th minute of a 2–1 home victory against Cesena in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals; the win enabled Roma to advance to the semi-finals of the tournament.[193] On 15 April, he came on as a substitute in a 1–1 home draw against Atalanta to make his 615th appearance in Serie A, equalling Javier Zanetti as the joint third highest appearance holder of all time in Serie A.[194] On 28 May, Totti made his final appearance for Roma in a 3–2 home win against Genoa, coming on as a substitute for Mohamed Salah in the 54th minute, and received a standing ovation from the fans.[195] Totti first came into international prominence while playing in FIFA and UEFA youth tournaments. With the Italy under-16 side, under manager Sergio Vatta, Totti reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship in Turkey; Italy were defeated 1–0 by Poland, as Totti missed the final due to suspension.[196] Four months later, Totti played in 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan and scored Italy's goal in the tournament as the Azzurrini were eliminated in group stage.[197] Totti also scored in Italy's 4–1 defeat to Spain in the final of the UEFA Under-18 Championship, in July 1995.[198] He subsequently won the UEFA Under-21 Championship with Italy in 1996, under manager Cesare Maldini; in the final, he opened the scoring as the match ended in a 1–1 draw against Spain, although Italy were able to win the final on penalties.[199][200] The following year, he also played a key role in helping Italy to win a gold medal at the 1997 Mediterranean Games, on home soil, scoring twice throughout the tournament.[201][202] Due to his contribution in these tournaments, Totti was later included in the all-time Under-21 Euro dream team in 2015.[203] After starring with the Azzurrini in Italy's under-16, under-19 and under-21 sides, Totti earned his first senior cap for Italy under the recently appointed international manager Dino Zoff during a 2–0 Euro 2000 qualifying victory against Switzerland on 10 October 1998.[204] Totti scored his first goal for Italy on 26 April 2000 in a 2–0 friendly win over Portugal in Reggio Calabria.[205] He scored his first brace for Italy in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match in a 4–3 home win over Belarus, on 13 October 2004.[206] In total, Totti made 58 appearances for Italy between 1998 and 2006, scoring nine goals and making 24 assists.[9][207] Italy went to Euro 2000 with Totti in excellent form. Overall, he scored two goals and provided an assist during the tournament.[208] His first goal of the tournament came against co-host nation Belgium in the first round, as Totti headed in Demetrio Albertini's cross from a set-piece;[209] he was named man of the match for his performance.[210] His second goal of the tournament came against Romania in the quarter-finals, with an accurate strike following Stefano Fiore's assist.[211] In Italy's semi-final shootout victory over co-hosts the Netherlands, Totti's confidently chipped penalty was named as one of the ""magic moments"" of the tournament.[212][213] A few moments before taking the penalty, Totti whispered the famous sentence ""Mo je faccio er Cucchiaio"" (Roman dialect for ""Now I'm scoring with a Panenka"") to his teammate and friend Luigi Di Biagio.[214] Though Italy lost to reigning World Cup Champions France 2–1 in extra time in the final, he started the play which led to Marco Delvecchio's opening goal; Totti sent an unmarked Gianluca Pessotto down the right wing with a back-heel pass, allowing him space to cross the ball into the area, where it was put into the net by Delvecchio.[215][216] Later, during the second half of the match, Totti provided two scoring opportunities for Alessandro Del Piero, which the Juventus forward was unable to convert.[217] Totti was selected for the 22-man Team of the Tournament due to his performances throughout the European Championship.[218] After being handed the number 10 shirt and Italy's playmaking duties, much was expected of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni.[219] Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 2–0 opening win over Ecuador,[220] disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri's goal in a disappointing and controversial 2–1 defeat to Croatia in Italy's second group match,[221] his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular his failure to capitalise on several scoring chances in Italy's 1–1 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.[222][223] Despite setting up Vieri's goal in Italy's second round defeat to co-hosts South Korea from a corner,[224] his performance was once again criticised,[225] in particular as he was sent off in extra time after being handed a controversial second yellow card by referee Byron Moreno for simulation.[226] Although he was once again expected to be Italy's star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy's opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals,[227] but never made it back to action and finished the competition scoreless due to Italy's elimination in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.[228] Despite injury troubles, Totti recovered in time to join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, despite a lack of match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome what could have been a career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).[229][230] Totti did recuperate in time and was eventually named to Lippi's final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup.[231] Despite initial concerns over his match fitness, Totti was an important player in Marcello Lippi's team,[230][232][233] and played in all seven games for Italy,[234] including the victorious final against France, which Italy won on penalties, although he was substituted off in the 61st minute.[235] He played the entire time in Germany with metal plates and screws in his ankle that had yet to be removed following the surgery.[230][232][233] Throughout the tournament, he usually played as an attacking midfielder, in front of deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo, and behind strikers Luca Toni, Alberto Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta, or Filippo Inzaghi; these players were supported defensively by Gennaro Gattuso, Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi in midfield.[234] Totti finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists, along with Juan Román Riquelme (4).[236] Totti set up Pirlo's goal from a short corner in Italy's opening 2–0 win against Ghana,[237][238] Marco Materazzi's goal from a corner in Italy's final group match, a 2–0 win against the Czech Republic,[239] and two goals in a 3–0 win against Ukraine in the quarter-finals: the opener by Gianluca Zambrotta, and one of Luca Toni's goals.[240] Totti also scored a goal via an injury-time penalty in Italy's 1–0 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June,[241] and was involved in Del Piero's last-minute extra-time goal in the semi-final, which sealed a 2–0 victory for the Italians over hosts Germany, and a place in the World Cup final.[242] Throughout the competition, Totti completed 185 passes and took 19 shots;[234] in recognition of a successful tournament, he was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team.[243] Totti intended to retire from international football after the 2006 World Cup, but reneged on his decision and remained undecided on his future for over a year, not being called up in the meantime. He made his retirement official on 20 July 2007, at the beginning of the 2007–08 Serie A season, due to recurring physical problems[8] and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma.[9] Italy's coach at the time, Roberto Donadoni, attempted to get Totti to change his mind for the remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers but was not successful.[244] After Marcello Lippi's reappointment as the national team's manager following Euro 2008, Totti announced that he would play in the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if he were to receive a call-up;[245] however, there was no official statement release from Totti or Lippi about a possible comeback.[246] For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said one of the reasons for Italy's early exit was due to the lack of creative players like Totti in the team.[247] In March 2013, Lippi's successor as Italy's coach, Cesare Prandelli, stated that he would consider Totti for the 2014 World Cup squad.[248][249] In October 2013, Prandelli said, ""Totti is in fantastic form. His condition right now does make you reflect. If the World Cup was around the corner, I would have no doubts and would absolutely call him up. But we will evaluate the player's condition one month prior to the World Cup.""[250] However, at the time of the choice of the final 23-man Italian squad for the World Cup, the Italy coach excluded the Roma striker, preferring to focus the team around younger players.[251] Some in the media criticised the decision, such as former Brazilian international footballer Cafu, who had been Totti's teammate at Roma, who revealed that he would have liked to see Totti competing for Italy at the World Cup in Brazil, and that he preferred the Roma captain over Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[252] Without Totti, Italy was eliminated in the first round for the second consecutive time, finishing third in their group.[253][254] In May 2016, several injuries in the Italian squad, as well as a lack of attacking options and Totti's run of good form as a substitute for Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy's Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later left out of Conte's 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.[255][256] ""A great player! What a phenomenon!"" — Lionel Messi comments on Totti after the 50th anniversary of the Joan Gamper trophy, between Barcelona and Roma.[257][258][259] ""Totti is an artist of football, a true Number 10."" — Michel Platini, former French midfielder and former UEFA President.[260] ""Totti is immortal and he is a symbol of our sport. I only regret not having worked with him."" — Carlo Ancelotti, former Italian midfielder and four time Champions League winning football manager.[261] Often referred to as Er Bimbo de Oro (The Golden Boy), L'Ottavo Re di Roma (The Eighth King of Rome), Er Pupone (The Big Baby), Il Capitano (The Captain), and Il Gladiatore (The Gladiator) by the Italian sports media,[262][263] Totti is considered to be one of the greatest Italian players of all time,[264][265][266][267][268] one of the best players of his generation,[269][270][271] and Roma's greatest ever player.[272] Totti is also regarded by some as Italy's greatest player ever.[266][267][268] Throughout his career, he played predominantly as a classic number 10, functioning either as an offensive-midfield playmaker or as a supporting or deep-lying forward behind the main striker;[273][274] only in the later years of his Roma career was he mainly employed as a lone striker.[275] An elegant, world-class, and technically gifted attacking midfielder with a good knowledge of the game, Totti was a tactically versatile player, capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and was also occasionally deployed as a winger or as a central midfielder under Zdeněk Zeman,[276][277] and most notably as a false 9 under Luciano Spalletti and Rudi Garcia.[58][275][278] Under Luis Enrique, he was also occasionally fielded in a more withdrawn creative role in midfield, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker.[279] While Totti was a prolific goalscorer, he was also renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, as well as his ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time.[280][281][282][283] Due to his movement and range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, unselfish and dynamic centre-forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian (which literally translates to ""manoeuvring centre-forward"").[7][275] Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.[15][21][284] Throughout his career, Totti utilised his balance, dribbling skills, and acceleration in order to get past opponents; despite being naturally right-footed, he possessed a powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the area with either foot,[268][273][280][282] and was also an accurate penalty kick[285] and free kick taker,[271][286] who was capable of striking the ball either with power or swerve from set pieces.[287] Totti also scored several goals from chipped shots throughout his career, and often used the technique on penalties, which was also known as the cucchiaio technique (or ""spoon"" in Italian);[288][289] one of the most famous instances in which Totti performed this type of penalty was in the victorious shootout of Italy's Euro 2000 semi-final match against the Netherlands.[288] One of his most famous lobbed goals, in which he dribbled past Inter's Marco Materazzi before chipping the ball over goalkeeper Júlio César, was later named the best goal in Serie A of the 2005–06 season.[290] He scored another notable goal using this technique against Lazio in the 2002 Derby della Capitale, which ended in a 5–1 win for Roma.[291] The title of Totti's 2006 autobiography Tutto Totti: Mo je faccio er cucchiaio (English: All about Totti: I'm gonna chip him now) referenced this technique, as well as the statement made to his Italy teammates before his memorable Euro 2000 semi-final shootout penalty against the Netherlands.[212][288][292] Having served as Roma's captain for several years, Totti was praised for his leadership.[293] Despite his talent and ability, however, Totti drew criticism at times for his character and lack of discipline on the pitch, which occasionally caused him to commit bad fouls and receive unnecessary bookings; with eleven red cards, he has the joint-sixth highest number of sending offs in Serie A history.[294][295][296] Totti was known for his exuberant and humorous goal celebrations. One of his famous celebrations took place on 11 April 1999 in the second Derby della Capitale of the 1998–99 season, in which he scored during the final minutes of the game and celebrated by flashing a T-shirt under his jersey, which read ""Vi ho purgato ancora"" (""I've purged you guys again""), in reference to events at the previous derby against Lazio on 29 November 1998 when Totti helped Roma come back from 3–1 down with an assist to Eusebio Di Francesco for 3–2 and finally a goal of his own for 3–3.[297] Another derby goal against Lazio saw him take over a sideline camera and aim it at the Roma fans.[297] Totti has displayed numerous T-shirts with messages on them from under his jersey over the years, including two for his wife; ""6 Unica"" (""You're One of a kind"") and ""6 Sempre Unica"" (""You're Still the One""),[297] and a political one ""Liberate Giuliana"" (""Free Giuliana"") in honor of Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist kidnapped in 2005 by insurgents in Iraq who was later freed. The most recent message was ""Scusate il Ritardo"" (""Sorry for the delay"") which he flashed on 8 January 2012 as an apology to fans for his goalscoring drought after scoring his first goal of the season versus Chievo.[297] As a tribute to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a childbirth scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and lying on his back while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children.[298][299] On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.[300] On 17 July 2017, Totti confirmed his retirement from professional football and announced that he had accepted an offer from his former team to become a club director.[301] On 18 September, Totti began studying for a course in order to obtain his UEFA B coaching licence.[302] However, he withdrew from the course two weeks later, as he was unable to attend the course regularly due to his commitments as a director of Roma; his former teammate Simone Perrotta took his place.[303] On 17 June 2019, he announced his resignation from his role at Roma, in an hour-long press conference held at the Italian Olympic Committee headquarters, where he publicly accused chairman James Pallotta and the management for not involving him enough in the club's decision making, stating he would reconsider a comeback only under a different ownership. This marked the end of his 30-year association with the club.[304][305] Totti married Ilary Blasi, a former showgirl and a co-host of Italia 1's Le Iene, on 19 June 2005 at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Their wedding was aired on television, with the proceeds being donated to charity. They had their first child on 6 November 2005. Their second child, a daughter, was born on 13 May 2007. The couple has often been referred to as the ""Italian Beckhams"", and their private lives are often speculated upon in Italian magazines and tabloids.[306] On 10 March 2016, the couple had their third child.[307] On 11 July 2022, it was announced that Totti and Blasi had separated.[308] Totti is a Roman Catholic.[15][309] Totti's brother Riccardo serves as his agent,[15][310] and manages many of his brand and business interests, under the name Number Ten, including the Francesco Totti Academy, a football training school, and the Totti Soccer School, a football camp for children with disabilities. Totti also owns a motorcycle racing team called Totti Top Sport.[311] On 12 October 2020, Totti's father, Enzo, died at 76 years old due to COVID-19, amid the pandemic in Italy.[312] Totti became a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF in 2003,[313][314] and an ambassador for the FIFA/SOS Children's Villages in January 2006. As a fundraiser for a children's charity, he published two best-selling, self-effacing joke books, containing jokes the locals often told about him and his teammates. Some of the jokes were filmed in short sketches, featuring himself with good friends and national teammates Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Christian Vieri, Antonio Cassano, Marco Delvecchio, Alessandro Nesta and former national team coach Giovanni Trapattoni in a short show called La sai l'ultima di Totti. On 16 January 2008, he appeared as ""PaperTotti"" in the Disney comic series Topolino. The proceeds of the subscriptions were given to charity. The Roma captain's official testimonial was a fundraising match between singers and celebrities played on 12 May 2008 to help raise money for the construction of the Campus Produttivo della Legalità e della Solidarietà (Productive Campus of Legality and Solidarity).[315] In 2009, Totti helped launch a new campaign promoting Football Adopting Abandoned Children, which came about in collaboration with the Friends of Children and the Association of Italian Players. In the project, he adopted a team of around eleven young Kenyans to play football in Nairobi, and then to coach them along the way.[316] In 2015, Totti and several of his teammates took to the pitch for ""Tennis with Stars"" in the Foro Italico in Rome, an event to help disadvantaged children. Tennis players such as Novak Djokovic and Flavia Pennetta participated at the event.[317] On 27 September 2016, Totti celebrated his 40th birthday live on his new Facebook page,[318] at the Tor Crescenza castle in Rome.[319] Totti recorded a video message for a comatose hospital patient who awoke from her coma when his voice was played; Totti visited the patient in the hospital in September 2020.[320] In 2002, Fiat principal executive Gianni Agnelli, a lifelong fan and ex-president of Juventus, chose Totti to publicize the launch of the new Stilo instead of a Juventus player.[321] Having been signed to sportswear company Nike, Totti featured in Nike's ""Secret Tournament"" advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, in the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan.[322] He appeared alongside Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament ""referee"".[322][323] Totti has featured in EA Sports' FIFA video game series; he appeared on the cover of the Italian edition of FIFA 2002.[324] He also featured on the cover of Pro Evolution Soccer 4, along with Thierry Henry and Italian referee Pierluigi Collina.[325] Between 2005 and 2008, his sponsors changed to sportswear company Diadora and soft drink Pepsi Twist, with a commercial filmed in the camps of Trigoria by director Gabriele Muccino. Since May 2006, he has appeared in advertisements for telephone company Vodafone. In December 2006, Totti and his wife Ilary Blasi lent their voices to an Italian dubbing of an episode of the television series The Simpsons entitled ""Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play"", in which Totti voiced Buck Mitchell.[326] In 2007, he appeared in the movie L'allenatore nel Pallone 2, in the role of a defense attorney. Since 2008, he has participated several times in the television program C'è posta per te, in the second series of the Italian drama Cesaroni, in the reality show Grande Fratello 8 and in an episode of Paperissima. In September 2008, a collection of figurines dedicated to him appeared in newsstands in the Lazio region entitled ""Francesco Totti, the captain"".[327] In 2009, Totti sent a message of support to Iranian youths during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests.[328][329] In February 2010, Totti was named an ambassador for online poker company Party Poker.[330] In May 2010, Totti appeared alongside actor Russell Crowe in Rome to promote the special edition of the film Gladiator, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the film's release.[331] In December 2014, two murals of Totti, sponsored by Nike, were created in Rome.[332][333] In 2014, the Swiss artist David Diehl painted Totti as one of 16 football icons most beloved by their fans.[334][335] In 2015, France Football rated him one of the ten best footballers in the world over the age of 36.[336] In 2015, Totti's famous selfie goal celebration was included amongst the goal celebrations available for FIFA 16 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2016; he also took a selfie in the official trailer of the video game on YouTube.[337][338] On 1 August 2017, a rocket carrying Totti's number 10 shirt from his final game with Roma against Genoa was launched into space from French Guiana.[339] In 2020 he was the subject of My Name Is Francesco Totti (Mi chiamo Francesco Totti), a documentary film by Alex Infascelli.[340]

"74539",":Article","  Cristian Damián Battocchio ( Italian pronunciation: [ˈkristjam batˈtɔkkjo]; born 10 February 1992) is a professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Indian Super League club Chennaiyin.[2] Born in Argentina, he represented Italy at several youth international levels.[3] Born in Rosario, Argentina, Battocchio arrived at Italian club Udinese in 2009[4] at the age of 16 from Newell's Old Boys in Argentina for a transfer fee of €200,000[2] In the 2010–11 season he became the captain of the youth team of Udinese.[5] On 27 February 2011, he made his debut with the first team of Udinese against Palermo In a historic 7–0 victory for Udinese,[5][6] coming on from the bench after the game had already been won.[6] On 29 September 2011, he made his second appearance with the first team in the UEFA Europa League competition, facing Celtic in a 1–1 draw.[7] before the match his first team coach Francesco Guidolin said that Battocchio was now ready for the first team and compared him to David Pizarro,[2] Johan Walem, the youth coach of Udinese, said ""he is now stable for the first team, has important qualities: vision of the game, a good foot, kick the penalties. He can do well as deep-lying playmaker"".[2] On 30 August 2012, Battocchio was loaned to Watford, with Watford having the choice to purchase him at the end of the deal. Battocchio played in Watford's 4–0 win over Huddersfield on 19 January, and scored Watford's final goal – his first for the club – with a lovely finish from a beautiful team move which has been described as one of the best team goals ever at Vicarage Road. This goal won Watford ""Goal Of The Season"" as voted by the fans and Battocchio was awarded the trophy. Battocchio then scored his second goal for Watford against Blackpool on 9 March 2013. Battocchio signed for Watford on a permanent basis on 19 July 2013, with the contract running for a period of three years until 2016.

She was described as ""world-class"" by Chelsea manager Emma Hayes, who previously worked with Carney at Arsenal and Chicago Red Stars.[35] ""She can make a massive difference. She is a very experienced international player, who has great quality and vision with the ball at her feet. She has been the real playmaker for both her former club Birmingham and for England as well, so it was a no-brainer for Chelsea to go after her."" Kelly Smith, MBE[36] During the 2016 FA WSL, Carney scored 3 goals in 16 matches.[17] Chelsea finished in second place with a 12–3–1 record.[37] She scored the game-opening goal in the club's 4–1 against Doncaster on 24 March off a penalty.[38] After the match, Hayes noted, ""Karen Carney was at the heart and the core of everything, especially in the first half, and she looks like she's been playing at Chelsea for years.

A year later, they won promotion to Ligue 1 as champions and he was named Goalkeeper of the Year at the Trophées UNFP du football.[1] However, veteran Frenchman Mickaël Landreau was preferred for the 2012–13 Ligue 1 season, and at its conclusion the Brazilian signed a two-year deal at Valenciennes FC also in the top flight.[2] At Valenciennes, Novaes was not first choice, including after relegation to Ligue 2, and also played occasionally for the reserve team in the fifth tier. In January 2015, he was loaned to third-tier Amiens SC for the rest of the season.[3] In October 2015, Novaes signed for AS Béziers for the rest of the Championnat National season.[4] He played all but three games in 2017–18 as they won promotion as runners-up to Red Star F.C., but in the ensuing Ligue 2 season he was absent with a knee injury from October to February, the first such absence of his career.[5] After his retirement in the summer 2020, Novaes was hired as goalkeeper coach at Béziers.[6] After manager Colbert Marlot was fired on 15 November 2021, Novaes was named caretaker manager.[7] Novaes was in charge for three games (2 victories, 1 defeat), before he was replaced by Alain Nègre on 14 December 2021. Novaes then continued in his original position as goalkeeper coach.[8]","Macedo Novaes","[""Magno Macedo Novaes"",""Brazilian"",""goalkeeper"",""Corsicans"",""Ligue 2"",""São Paulo"",""France"",""Colbert Marlot"",""games"",""promotion"",""third division"",""Championnat National"",""season"",""champions"",""tier"",""caretaker manager."",""Goalkeeper of the Year"",""choice"",""rest"",""rest"",""games"",""deal"",""flight."",""relegation"",""reserve team"",""conclusion"",""Ligue 1"",""AS Moulins"",""AC Arles-Avignon"",""promotion"",""goalkeeper coach"",""career."",""SC Bastia"",""absence"",""retirement"",""Valenciennes FC"",""Amiens SC"",""AS Béziers"",""games"",""Mickaël Landreau"",""Trophées UNFP du football."",""Frenchman"",""goalkeeper coach."",""charge"",""victories"",""defeat"",""position"",""Béziers."",""season"",""knee injury"",""runners-up"",""Alain Nègre"",""Red Star F.C."",""2"",""2"",""2008"",""2010"",""2012"",""January 2015"",""October 2015"",""2017"",""2020"",""15 November 2021"",""14 December 2021"",""3"",""1"",""8"",""6"",""1"",""7"",""2020"",""11"",""2015"",""2017"",""2"",""18"",""30 March 1983"",""13"",""three"",""4"",""30"",""2005"",""2"",""5"",""15"",""2008"",""2012"",""2015"",""1983"",""2021"",""two"",""1"",""2010"",""1"",""2"",""three"",""two"",""14"",""2021"",""2005""]","0.005347824577828344","true","[0.7904841,0.06735672,0.024040455,0.01097998,0.008545828,0.005179367,0.005179367,0.0044394224,0.004106535,0.003736263,0.0032918355,0.003267332,0.002969278,0.0027650755,0.0025686144,0.0024556126,0.0024473895,0.002444782,0.0023378415,0.0023378415,0.0022718925,0.0022432862,0.0022432862,0.0022432862,0.0022432862,0.0022158867,0.0021023403,0.0019639314,0.0019639314,0.0018509474,0.0017621221,0.0017621221,0.0016451579,0.0015478798,0.0015478798,0.0014980334,0.0013823698,0.0013823698,0.0013523744,0.0013101888,0.0013101888,0.0013101888,0.0012311575,0.0010834503,0.0010834503,0.0010834503,0.0010813973,0.0010416874,9.100157E-4,6.7874434E-4,6.7874434E-4,6.402999E-4,4.01056E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Magno Novaes - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magno_Novaes",,,,,,,

"74543",":Article","    Portuguese professional footballer Eponyms and public art Films Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM ( Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time. Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr. Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness World Records.[9] With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020. One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career. Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.[10][11] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, who worked as a cook in the hospitality industry and a cleaning woman,[12][13] and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener at the Junta de Freguesia of Santo António and part-time kit man for football club Andorinha.[14][15][16] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, an African woman, was born in the island of São Vicente, in what was then Portuguese Cape Verde, and moved to Madeira Island at 16.[17][18] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia ""Katia"".[19] He was named after actor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[20] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure,[21][22] as abortions were illegal in Portugal at that time.[23] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[24] As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[25] where his father was the kit man,[14] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[26] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth system.[26] By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in the Telheiras area of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and his tutor at Sporting CP, Leonel Pontes,[27] to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[28][29] With a troubled life as a student[30] and living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family, he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[31][32] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had ""disrespected"" him.[28] One year later, he was diagnosed with tachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[33] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[34] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[35] In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be a bricklayer if he hadn't become a professional football player.[36] At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[37] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[26] On 14 August 2002,[38] Cristiano Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for a Sporting CP's senior team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th[38] minute in place of Toñito.[39][40] As far as the Portuguese football league system's competitions is concerned, Sporting CP B was the 1st team in his senior career playing domestically, where he debuted in a 2–1 away loss against Sport Clube Lusitânia on 1 September 2002, in a game for the Segunda Divisão B championship played in the Azores.[41] On 29 September 2002, Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga, playing for Sporting CP's main team against Braga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win.[42] Over the course of the 2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta.[43] Manager Arsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him at Arsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[44] Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade on 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[45] Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million[45] for what he considered to be ""one of the most exciting young players"" he had ever seen.[46] A decade after his departure from the club, in 2013, Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.[47] ""There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."" —Former Manchester United player George Best hails the 18-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo in 2003.[48] Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[49] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[50] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[51] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[52] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: ""He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.""[53] Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in the Premier League on 16 August 2003, and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt.[54] His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as ""undoubtedly the most exciting debut"" he had ever seen.[48] Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November.[55] Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign,[56] the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received the first red card of his career.[57] Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final, earning his first trophy.[58] BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final.[59] The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his ""elaborate"" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[60] but teammate Gary Neville said he was ""not a show pony, but the real thing"", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[61] ""He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."" —Former BBC pundit Alan Hansen commenting on Ronaldo after his first season.[59] Ronaldo scored United's 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004, their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough.[62] A few weeks later, he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010.[63] At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal.[64][65] He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, which ended in a goalless draw; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out, United lost 5–4.[66] Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, the Football League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic.[67] During his third season in England, Ronaldo was involved in several incidents. He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a ""one-fingered gesture"" towards Benfica fans,[68] and was sent off in the Manchester derby (a 3–1 defeat) for kicking Manchester City's former United player Andy Cole.[69] Ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play.[70] Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off,[71] Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident.[72] United denied the possibility of him leaving the club.[73] Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season,[74] it proved to be his break-out year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title. An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known.[75] He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December, against Aston Villa (a win that put United on top of the league), Wigan and Reading.[76][77][78] Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.[79] At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[80] scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma.[81] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[82] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[83] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat.[84] Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May (his 50th goal for the club), as United won their first league title in four years.[85] As a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. He won the Professional Footballers' Association's Player's Player, Fans' Player and Young Player of the Year awards, as well as the Football Writers' Association's Footballer of the Year award,[86][87] becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours.[88] His wages were raised to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension.[89] Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d'Or,[90] and came third, behind Kaká and Lionel Messi, in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[91] Ronaldo scored his first hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008, which put United top of the league table.[92] On 19 March, he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win.[93] His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, surpassing George Best's total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season, setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder.[94] His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot,[95] as well as the European Golden Shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award.[96] He additionally received the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season.[97][98] In the knockout stage of the Champions League, Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon to help United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate;[99] while playing as a striker, he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma.[100] United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow on 21 May, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out,[101] United emerged victorious 1–1, winning the penalties 6–5.[102][103] As the Champions League top scorer, Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year.[104] Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in England. He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him.[105] As rumours circulated of Ronaldo's interest in moving to Real Madrid, United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action.[106] FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as ""modern slavery"".[107] Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter,[108] he remained at United for another year.[109] Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[110] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[111] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[112] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.[113] At the close of 2008, Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan,[114] assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process.[115] With his 2008 Ballon d'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year, Ronaldo became United's first Ballon d'Or winner since Best in 1968,[116] and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year.[117] His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award, presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year;[118] he later called it the best goal he had ever scored.[119] United advanced to the final in Rome,[120] where he made little impact in United's 2–0 defeat to Barcelona.[121] Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies, as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup.[122][123] He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances.[124] His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford.[125] Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time of £80 million (€94 million).[126] His contract, which ran until 2015, was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause.[127] At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli.[128] Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 (the number Ronaldo wore at United), Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt,[129] which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[130] Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August, scoring a penalty in a 3–2 home win.[131] He scored in each of his first four league games, the first Madrid player to do so.[132] His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich.[133] His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks.[134][135] A week after his return, he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería.[136] Midway through the season, Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards, behind Messi. He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010, his first in La Liga,[137][138] and became Real Madrid's highest goalscorer that season. Although Ronaldo helped amass a club record 96 points in the league, he did not win a trophy in his first season.[139][140] Following Raúl's departure, Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season.[141] His subsequent return to his Ballon d'Or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October.[142] Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao, Levante, Villarreal and Málaga.[143][144][145] Despite his performances, he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d'Or.[146] During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011, Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions. Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final, winning his first trophy in Spain.[147][148] His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals.[149] In addition to the Pichichi Trophy, Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues.[150] During the following season, Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions.[151] He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.[152][153][154] Ronaldo found greater team success in the league, helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points. Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona,[155] he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás.[156] Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season.[157] His final league goal of the season, against Mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by Messi,[158] though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season.[159] Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España, his third trophy in Spain. With a goal in each leg, he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona.[160] Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a ""professional issue"" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid,[161] his goalscoring rate did not suffer. After netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against Deportivo, he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax.[162] Four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou.[163] His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, behind four-time winner Messi.[164] Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January.[165] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.[166] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[167] He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.[168] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico, which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[169] a club record.[160] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 extra time defeat to Atlético, but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[170] In the first knockout round of the Champions League, Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time. After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home,[171] he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford.[172] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect.[173] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg.[174] At the start of the 2013–14 season, Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of €17 million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football.[175] He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale, whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior.[176] Together with striker Karim Benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed ""BBC"", an acronym of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).[177] By late November, Ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against Galatasaray, Sevilla, Real Sociedad, Northern Ireland, and Sweden.[178][179][180] He ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally.[181] He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career.[182] Concurrently with his individual achievements, Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date, as he helped Madrid win La Décima, their tenth European Cup. His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund (his 100th Champions League match) took his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record Messi had set two years before.[183] After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena,[184] he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético, becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams.[185] His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. Ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: ""In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks"".[186] As the competition's top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals,[187] he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe.[188] In the Copa del Rey, Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón,[189] the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match.[190] His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy.[191] Ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with Liverpool striker Luis Suárez.[192] Among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio, who had died two days before.[193] A last-minute, back-heeled volley scored against Valencia on 4 May (his 50th goal in all competitions) was recognised as the best goal of the season by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional,[194] which additionally named Ronaldo the Best Player in La Liga.[195] During the 2014–15 season, Ronaldo set a new personal best of 61 goals, starting with both goals in Madrid's 2–0 win over Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup.[196] He subsequently achieved his best-ever goalscoring start to a league campaign, with 15 goals in the first eight rounds.[197] His record 23rd La Liga hat-trick, scored against Celta Vigo on 6 December, made him the fastest player to reach 200 goals in La Liga, reaching the milestone in 178th matches.[197][198] After winning the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup,[199] Ronaldo received the 2014 Ballon d'Or,[200] joining Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini and Marco van Basten as a three-time recipient.[201] Madrid finished in second place in La Liga and exited at the semi-final stage in the Champions League.[202] In the latter competition, Ronaldo extended his run of scoring away to a record 12 matches with his strike in a 2–0 win against Schalke 04.[203] He scored both of his side's goals in the semi-finals against Juventus, where Madrid were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate.[204] With 10 goals, he finished as top scorer for a third consecutive season, alongside Messi and Neymar.[205] On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada.[206] His 300th goal for his club followed three days later in a 2–0 win against Rayo Vallecano.[207] Subsequent hat-tricks against Sevilla, Espanyol and Getafe took his number of hat-tricks for Madrid to 31, surpassing Di Stéfano's club record of 28.[196] He finished the season with 48 goals, winning a second consecutive Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe for a record fourth time.[196] At the start of his seventh season at Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's previous record holder, Raúl.[208] A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals.[note 4] Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals.[210] Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country.[211] He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group stage, setting the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö.[212] Ronaldo's four goals in a 7–1 home win over Celta de Vigo on 5 March 2016 took his total to 252 goals in La Liga, becoming the competition's second-highest scorer in history behind Messi.[213] He scored a hat-trick against VfL Wolfsburg to send his club into the Champions League semi-finals.[214] The treble took his tally in the competition to 16 goals, making him the top scorer for the fourth consecutive season and the fifth overall.[215] Suffering apparent fitness issues, Ronaldo gave a poorly-received performance in the final against Atlético, in a repeat of the 2014 final, though his penalty in the subsequent shoot-out secured Madrid's 11th victory.[216] For the sixth successive year, he ended the season having scored over 50 goals across all competitions.[216] For his efforts during the season, he received the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award for a second time.[217] Ronaldo missed Madrid's first three matches of the 2016–17 season, including the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, as he continued to rehabilitate the knee injury he suffered against France in the Euro 2016 final.[218] On 15 September, he did not celebrate his late free kick equaliser against Sporting CP in the Champions League, with Ronaldo stating post match that ""they made me who I am"".[219] On 7 November, his contract was updated for the second time and extended by three years to 2021.[220] On 19 November, he scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 away win against Atlético, making him the all-time top scorer in the Madrid derby with 18 goals.[221] On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 win over Club América in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[222] He then scored a hat-trick in the 4–2 win over Japanese club Kashima Antlers in the final.[223] Ronaldo finished the tournament as top scorer with four goals and was also named player of the tournament.[224] He won the 2016 Ballon d'Or, his fourth, and the inaugural 2016 The Best FIFA Men's Player, a revival of the former FIFA World Player of the Year, largely owing to his success with Portugal in winning Euro 2016.[225] In the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals against Bayern in April, Ronaldo scored both goals in a 2–1 away win which saw him make history by becoming the first player to reach 100 goals in UEFA club competition.[226] In the second leg of the quarter-finals, Ronaldo scored a 'perfect' hat-trick and reached his 100th Champions League goal, becoming the first player to do so as Madrid again defeated Bayern 4–2 after extra-time.[227] On 2 May, Ronaldo scored another hat-trick as Madrid defeated Atlético 3–0 in the Champions League semi-final first leg. On 17 May, Ronaldo overtook Jimmy Greaves as the all-time top scorer in the top five European leagues, scoring twice against Celta de Vigo.[228] He finished the season with 42 goals in all competitions as he helped Madrid to win their first La Liga title since 2012.[229] In the Champions League Final, Ronaldo scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Juventus to take him to 12 goals for the season, making him the competition's top goalscorer for the fifth straight season (sixth overall), as well as the first player to score in three finals in the Champions League era; the second goal was the 600th of his senior career.[230] Madrid also became the first team to win back-to-back finals in the Champions League era.[231] At the start of the 2017–18 season, Ronaldo scored Madrid's second goal in the 80th minute of a 3–1 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España at Camp Nou; however, he was sent off two minutes later and missed the second leg.[232] On 23 October, his performances throughout 2017 saw him awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.[233] On 6 December, he became the first player to score in all six Champions League group stage matches with a curling strike at home to Dortmund.[234] A day later, Ronaldo won the 2017 Ballon d'Or, receiving his fifth-time award on the Eiffel Tower in Paris.[235] On 16 December, he scored a free kick winner, as Madrid won their second Club World Cup in a row by beating Grêmio in the final.[236] On 3 March 2018, he scored two goals in a 3–1 home win over Getafe, his first being his 300th La Liga goal in his 286th appearance, making him the fastest player to reach this landmark and only the second player to do so after Messi.[237] On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6–3 win against Girona.[238] On 3 April, Ronaldo scored the first two goals in a 3–0 away win against Juventus in the quarter-finals of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, with his second goal being an acrobatic bicycle kick. Described as a ""PlayStation goal"" by Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli, with Ronaldo's foot approximately 7 ft 7 in (2.31 m) off the ground, it garnered him a standing ovation from the opposing fans in the stadium as well as a plethora of plaudits from peers, pundits and coaches.[239] On 11 April, he scored in the second leg at home to Juventus, a 98th-minute injury time penalty in a 3–1 defeat, meaning Madrid advanced 4–3 on aggregate.[240] It was his tenth goal against Juventus, a Champions League record against a single club.[241] In the final on 26 May, Madrid defeated Liverpool 3–1, winning Ronaldo his fifth Champions League title, the first player to do so.[242] He finished as the top scorer of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season with 15 goals.[243] After the final, Ronaldo referred to his time with Madrid in the past tense, sparking speculation that he could leave the club.[244] Despite months of negotiation to sign a new Real Madrid contract,[245] on 10 July 2018, Ronaldo signed a four-year contract with Italian club Juventus after completing a €100 million transfer, which included an additional €12 million in other fees and solidarity contributions to Ronaldo's youth clubs.[246] The transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old,[247] and the highest paid by an Italian club.[248] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[249] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[250] On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona.[251] On 16 September, Ronaldo scored his first two goals for Juventus in his fourth appearance in a 2–1 home win over Sassuolo in Serie A; his second was the 400th league goal of his career.[252] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juventus, against Valencia, he was sent off in the 29th minute for ""violent conduct"", his first red card in 154 tournament appearances.[253] Ronaldo became the first player in history to win 100 Champions League matches, setting up Mario Mandžukić's winner in a 1–0 home win over Valencia, which sealed Juventus's passage to the knock-out stages of the competition.[254] In December, he scored his tenth league goal of the season, from the penalty spot, the third in a 3–0 away win over Fiorentina.[255] After placing second in both the UEFA Men's Player of the Year and The Best FIFA Men's Player for the first time in three years, behind Luka Modrić, Ronaldo performances in 2018 also saw him voted runner-up for the 2018 Ballon d'Or, finishing once again behind his former teammate.[256] Ronaldo won his first trophy with the club on 16 January 2019, the 2018 Supercoppa Italiana, after he scored the only goal from a header against AC Milan.[257] On 10 February, Ronaldo scored in a 3–0 win over Sassuolo, the ninth consecutive away game in which he had scored in the league, equalling Giuseppe Signori's single season Serie A record of most consecutive away games with at least one goal.[258] On 12 March, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 home win against Atlético in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, helping Juventus overcome a two-goal deficit to reach the quarter-finals.[259] The following month, he scored his 125th goal in the competition, opening the scoring in a 1–1 away draw in the quarter-final first leg against Ajax on 10 April.[260] In the second leg in Turin on 16 April, he scored the opening goal, but Juventus eventually lost the match 2–1 and were eliminated from the competition.[261] On 20 April, Ronaldo played in the scudetto clinching game against Fiorentina, as Juventus won their eighth successive title after a 2–1 home win, thereby becoming the first player to win league titles in England, Spain and Italy.[262] On 27 April, he scored his 600th club goal, the equaliser in a 1–1 away draw against Derby d'Italia rivals Inter Milan.[263] Ending his first Serie A campaign with 21 goals and 8 assists, Ronaldo won the inaugural Serie A award for Most Valuable Player.[264] Ronaldo scored his first goal of the 2019–20 season in a 4–3 home league win over Napoli on 31 August 2019.[265] On 23 September, he came in 3rd place for the Best FIFA Men's Player Award.[266] On 1 October, he reached several milestones in Juventus's 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Bayer Leverkusen: he scored in a 14th consecutive season, equalling Raúl and Messi's record; he broke Iker Casillas' record for most Champions League wins of all time, and equalled Raúl's record of scoring against 33 different opponents.[267] On 6 November in a 2–1 away win against Lokomotiv Moscow, he equalled Paolo Maldini as the second-most capped player in UEFA club competitions with 174 appearances.[268] On 18 December, Ronaldo leapt to a height of 8 ft 5 in (2.57 m), higher than the crossbar, to head the winning goal in a 2–1 away win against Sampdoria.[269] He scored his first Serie A hat-trick on 6 January 2020, in a 4–0 home win against Cagliari. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis Sánchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A.[270] On 2 February, he scored twice from the penalty spot in a 3–0 home win over Fiorentina, equalling David Trezeguet's club record of scoring in nine consecutive league games,[271] and broke the record six days later by scoring in his tenth consecutive league game, a 2–1 away defeat to Hellas Verona.[272] On 22 February, Ronaldo scored for a record-equalling 11th consecutive league game, alongside Gabriel Batistuta and Fabio Quagliarella, in what was his 1,000th senior professional game, a 2–1 away win against SPAL.[273] On 22 June, he scored a penalty in a 2–0 away win over Bologna, overtaking Rui Costa to become the highest scoring Portuguese player in Serie A history.[274] On 4 July, he scored his 25th league goal from a free kick in a 4–1 home win over rivals Torino, becoming the first Juventus player to achieve this milestone since Omar Sívori in 1961; the goal was also his first from a free kick with the club after 43 attempts.[275] On 20 July, Ronaldo scored twice in a 2–1 home win over Lazio; his first goal was his 50th in Serie A. He became the second-fastest player to reach this landmark, after Gunnar Nordahl, and the first player in history to reach 50 goals in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. With his brace, he also reached 30 league goals for the season, becoming just the third player (after Felice Borel in 1934 and John Hansen in 1952) in Juventus's history to reach that milestone in a season.[276][277] Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948.[278] On 26 July, Ronaldo scored the opening goal in a 2–0 home win over Sampdoria as Juventus were crowned Serie A champions for a ninth consecutive time.[279] He finished his second league campaign with 31 goals, making him the second-highest goalscorer in the league behind only European Golden Shoe winner Ciro Immobile, with 36 goals.[280][281] On 7 August, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 2–1 home win against Lyon in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16, which saw him finish the season with 37 goals in all competitions; the tally allowed him to break Borel's club record of 36 goals in a single season.[282] Despite the win, the tie finished 2–2 on aggregate and Juventus were eliminated from the competition on the away goals rule.[283] On 20 September 2020, Ronaldo scored in Juventus's opening league match of the season, a 3–0 home win over Sampdoria.[284] On 1 November, having taken nearly three weeks to recover from COVID-19, he returned to action against Spezia; he came off the bench in the second half and scored within the first three minutes, before scoring a second goal from the penalty spot in an eventual 4–1 away win.[285] On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal.[286] Ronaldo played his 100th match in all competitions for Juventus on 13 December, scoring two penalties in a 3–1 away win over Genoa in the league to bring his goal tally to 79.[287] On 20 January 2021, Juventus won the 2020 Supercoppa Italiana after a 2–0 win against Napoli, with Ronaldo scoring the opening goal.[288] On 2 March, he scored a goal in a 3–0 win over Spezia in his 600th league match, to become the first player to score at least 20 goals in 12 consecutive seasons in the top five leagues of Europe.[289] On 14 March, he scored his 57th career hat-trick in a 3–1 away win over Cagliari.[290] On 12 May, Ronaldo scored a goal in a 3–1 away win over Sassuolo to reach his 100th goal for Juventus in all competitions on his 131st appearance, becoming the fastest Juventus player to achieve the feat.[291] With Juventus's victory in the 2021 Coppa Italia Final on 19 May, Ronaldo became the first player in history to win every major domestic trophy in England, Spain and Italy.[292] Ronaldo ended the season with 29 league goals, winning the Capocannoniere award for highest goalscorer and becoming the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues.[293] On 22 August, Ronaldo started the first game of the new season on the bench, coming on as a substitute for Álvaro Morata in a 2–2 draw against Udinese, scoring a goal that was ruled out by VAR.[294] Though manager Massimiliano Allegri confirmed it was his decision due to Ronaldo's fitness, it came amid reports Ronaldo would depart the club before the closure of the transfer window,[295] and Ronaldo would tell Allegri he had ""no intention"" of remaining a Juventus player.[296] On 26 August, Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes reached a verbal agreement with Manchester City over personal terms,[297] but the club pulled out of the deal the following day due to the overall cost of the transfer.[298] On the same day, it was confirmed that City's rivals Manchester United, Ronaldo's former club, were in advanced talks to sign him,[299][300] while former manager Alex Ferguson and several ex-teammates had been in contact to persuade him to re-sign for United.[301][302] On 27 August 2021, Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Juventus to re-sign Ronaldo, subject to agreement of personal terms, visa and medical.[303] The transfer was for an initial £12.85 million, with a two-year contract plus an optional year, and was confirmed on 31 August.[304] Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt after Edinson Cavani agreed to switch to 21.[305] The first 24 hours of Ronaldo's shirt sales was reported to have broken the all-time record following a transfer, overtaking Messi after his move to Paris Saint-Germain.[306] On 11 September, Ronaldo made his second debut at Old Trafford, scoring the opening two goals in a 4–1 league victory against Newcastle United.[307] On 29 September, he scored a last-minute winner in United's 2–1 victory at home to Villarreal in the Champions League, and overtook Iker Casillas as the player with the most appearances in the competition.[308] In the next Champions League fixture on 20 October, Ronaldo again scored a last minute winner, helping United overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3–2 home victory against Atalanta,[309] and scored both goals, including a last minute equaliser, in the reverse fixture against Atalanta on 2 November.[310] On 23 November, Ronaldo became the first player to score in five consecutive matches of a Champions League campaign for an English club, after opening United's 2–0 victory away against Villarreal, with his six goals being crucial to United's qualifying for the round of 16 as group winners.[311] On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals.[312] The following month, after enduring a fractured relationship with his teammates and interim manager Ralf Rangnick, his performances and his team's declined during the season, with Ronaldo equalling his worst goalscoring run since 2010 during his time with Real Madrid, being two months without scoring a goal,[313] before scoring his first goal in the new year, opening United's 2–0 win home against Brighton & Hove Albion on 15 February 2022.[314] Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican's record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals,[315] although the Football Association of the Czech Republic claimed that Bican had scored 821 career goals.[316] On 16 April, Ronaldo scored his 50th club hat-trick in a 3–2 win over Norwich City.[317] On 23 April, he scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3–1 defeat to Arsenal.[318] After scoring in the following matches against Chelsea and Brentford, he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for April.[319] He finished the season with 24 goals in all competitions, 18 of those goals being in the Premier League, making him the third-highest goalscorer in the league behind Golden Boot winners Mohamed Salah and Son Heung-min, being named in the Premier League Team of the Year and the winner of United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award, given to the club's best player from the previous season;[320][321] however, with United finishing in a disappointing sixth place and qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, Ronaldo went trophyless for the first time since 2010.[322] After growing dissatisfaction with the direction of United on and off the field, Ronaldo missed the club's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia due to family reasons, amid reports of his desire to leave to join a club competing in the Champions League, despite incoming manager Erik ten Hag insisting that he was not for sale and was part of the club's plans.[323] His agent Jorge Mendes began negotiating with various clubs for a transfer on loan or on a free transfer, including Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, with the latter club's new owner Todd Boehly being keen on a possible transfer.[324] However, due to his age, overall cost of a transfer and high wages demands, multiple European clubs rejected the opportunity to sign him, including Chelsea after their manager Thomas Tuchel did not approve his signing.[325] Having failed to secure a transfer, Ronaldo lost his place in the starting line-up to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, mostly featuring in Europa League matches. He scored his first goal in the competition aged 37, converting a penalty to make it 2–0 against Sheriff Tiraspol on 15 September.[326] On 2 October, Ronaldo was an unused substitute in United's 6–3 loss to Manchester City, with ten Hag saying that he refused to bring him on out of ""respect for his big career"".[327] On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2–1 win against Everton.[328] Ten days later, Ronaldo refused to be brought on as a substitute during a home game against Tottenham and left the ground before the full-time whistle;[329][330] Ten Hag punished him by dropping him from the squad for an upcoming fixture with Chelsea, and made him train separately from the first team.[331][332] Following discussions with the manager, Ronaldo returned to training and started in United's home win over Sheriff on 27 October, scoring the third goal and ensuring United's qualification to the Europa League knockout stage.[333] Ten Hag named Ronaldo as captain for a 3–1 defeat to Aston Villa on 6 November, saying that Ronaldo was ""an important part of the squad, we are happy with him and now he has to take even more of the leader role"".[334] Ronaldo then missed United's following matches before the World Cup break, with Ten Hag saying that Ronaldo was ill.[335] On 14 November, an interview with Piers Morgan was published, where Ronaldo said that he felt ""betrayed"" by Ten Hag and senior executives who wanted Ronaldo to leave the club, and accused the club of doubting him regarding the illness of his daughter that led him to miss pre-season, adding that he did not respect ten Hag ""because he doesn't show respect for me"", leading him to be disappointed with the communication of the club.[336] Ronaldo claimed that ten Hag deliberately provoked him by first leaving him on the bench against City, and then wanting to bring him on in the final moments against Tottenham, but added that he regretted his decision to leave early.[336] He also questioned the appointment of Rangnick the previous season as he was a ""sporting director and not even a coach"".[336][337] On the club itself, Ronaldo stated there was ""no evolution"" since the departure of former manager Alex Ferguson in 2013, despite expecting changes in ""technology, infrastructure"".[336][337] Ronaldo claimed that the Glazer family ""did not care about the club"" as he never spoke with them, and described United as a ""marketing club"".[336][337] Following the interview, which aired in two-parts on 16 and 17 November, United began seeking legal action over whether Ronaldo had breached his contract,[338] and were looking to terminate his contract.[339] On 22 November, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement with immediate effect.[340] On 30 December 2022, Saudi club Al Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club effective 1 January 2023, signing a contract until 2025.[341] As reported by Fabrizio Romano of The Guardian, Ronaldo received the highest football salary in history, worth €200 million per year;[342][343] this included an annual guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals included bringing his total annual salary to €200 million. He was also reportedly paid a signing-on bonus in the region of €100 million.[344] According to Romano, Ronaldo rejected a move to Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City to join Al Nassr.[345] Ronaldo was due to appear in a match against Al-Tai on 5 January 2023, but had to serve a two-match ban incurred while he was still at Manchester United for knocking a phone out of a 14-year-old Everton fan's hand after a 1–0 loss at Goodison Park in April 2022.[346] On 19 January, Ronaldo played for the first time since transferring to Saudi Arabia, in an exhibition game featuring a combined team of Riyadh's Al Nassr and Al Hilal players against Paris Saint-Germain. Ronaldo scored twice in a 5–4 loss.[347] He made his debut for Al Nassr on 22 January, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win over Al-Ettifaq,[348] and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty.[349] On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal.[350] On 25 February, he scored his second hat-trick for the club, helping his side to a 3–0 away league victory against Damac.[351] Ronaldo was awarded the Player of the Month award for February after scoring eight goals and assisting twice.[352] Ronaldo spent another season without winning a league title, as Al Nassr finished second in the league in the 2022–23 season.[353] Ronaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Mané, N'Golo Kanté, Rúben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.[354] He scored his first goal of the 2023–24 season in a 4–1 win over Union Monastirienne in the Arab Club Champions Cup on 31 July.[355] In the next Arab Club Champions Cup fixture on 3 August, Ronaldo scored a late equaliser against Zamalek, to help his side secure a 1–1 draw and qualify for the quarter-finals in second place of their group.[356] In the semi-finals on 9 August, Ronaldo scored the only goal of a win over Al-Shorta, converting a penalty to help Al Nassr reach their first ever Arab Club Champions Cup final.[357] In the final on 12 August, Ronaldo scored both goals for a ten-man Al Nassr as they defeated rivals Al-Hilal 2–1 after extra time to win the competition for the first time in their history. Ronaldo was awarded the competition's top scorer award having scored six goals in the competition.[358] On 18 August, Ronaldo made his first league appearance of the season in a 2–0 defeat to Al-Taawoun,[359] and scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 5–0 away win against Al-Fateh a week later.[360] On 29 August, Ronaldo scored twice and assisted once in a 4–0 win against rivals Al-Shabab.[361] Ronaldo was awarded the SPL Player of the Month award for August after scoring five goals and assisting twice.[362] On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr's 5–1 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal.[363] On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2–0 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws).[364] Ronaldo received the SPL Player of the Month award for a second consecutive month after recording five goals and three assists in September.[365] On 2 October, he scored his first AFC Champions League goal in the home fixture against Istiklol, the equaliser in an eventual 3–1 win.[366] Ronaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall.[7] Aged 18, Ronaldo made his first senior appearance for Portugal in a 1–0 win over Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003,[367] coming on as a half-time substitute for Luís Figo.[368] He was subsequently called up for UEFA Euro 2004, held in his home country, and scored his first international goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to eventual champions Greece, his eighth appearance for Portugal.[368] After converting his penalty in a shoot-out against England in the quarter-finals,[369] he helped Portugal reach the final by scoring the opening goal in a 2–1 win over the Netherlands.[370] He was featured in the team of the tournament, having provided two assists in addition to his two goals.[371] Ronaldo was Portugal's second-highest scorer in their qualification group for the 2006 FIFA World Cup with seven goals.[367] During the tournament, he scored his first World Cup goal against Iran with a penalty kick in Portugal's second match of the group stage.[372] At the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.[373] In Portugal's infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands, Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz.[368] Following Portugal's 1–0 win, Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him, although he recovered in time to play in the next game.[374] In Portugal's quarter-final against England, Ronaldo's Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney's infraction,[375] the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining, after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal's bench following Rooney's dismissal.[368][376] Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals.[368] Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France.[377] FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.[368][378] Following the 2006 World Cup, Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008, scoring two goals in the process.[379][380] One day after turning 22, Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007,[381] as requested by Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) president Carlos Silva, who had died two days earlier.[381] Ahead of Euro 2008, he was given the number 7 shirt for the first time.[382] While he scored eight goals in qualifications,[383] the second-highest tally, he scored just one goal in the tournament, netting the second goal of their 3–1 win in the group stage match against the Czech Republic. In the same game, he also set-up Portugal's third goal in injury time, which was scored by Quaresma, and was named man of the match for his performance.[384][385] Portugal were eliminated in the quarter-finals with a 3–2 loss against eventual finalists Germany.[386] After Portugal's unsuccessful performance at Euro 2008, Luiz Felipe Scolari was replaced as coach by Carlos Queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at United.[387] Queiroz made Ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in July 2008.[388] Ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 World Cup,[368] as Portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina.[389] In the group stage of the World Cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches, against Ivory Coast, North Korea and Brazil.[390][391][392] His only goal of the tournament came in their 7–0 rout of North Korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months.[393] Portugal's World Cup ended with a 1–0 loss against eventual champions Spain in the round of 16.[394] Ronaldo scored seven goals in qualifications for Euro 2012, including two strikes against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the play-offs, to send Portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a ""group of death"".[395] In the last group stage game against the Netherlands, Ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2–1 win.[396] He scored a header in the quarter-final against the Czech Republic to give his team a 1–0 win.[397] In both games against the Netherlands and the Czech Republic he was named man of the match.[398][399] After the semi-finals against Spain ended scoreless, Portugal were eliminated in the penalty shoot-out.[400] Ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot.[401] Ronaldo's own teammate, Nani, said that Ronaldo ""demanded"" to take the last penalty.[402] As the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.[8] During the qualification for the 2014 World Cup, Ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. A qualifying match on 17 October 2012, a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland, earned him his 100th cap.[403] His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland, when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013.[404] After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, Ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against Sweden, billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović, which ensured their place at the tournament.[405] His hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equalling Pauleta's record.[406] Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.[407] Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury,[408] potentially risking his career.[409] Ronaldo later commented: ""If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't.""[410] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice,[411] Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat.[412] After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States,[413] he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana.[414] His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups.[415] Portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.[414] Ronaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against Armenia, in the qualification for Euro 2016.[416] With the only goal in another win over Armenia on 14 November 2014, he reached 23 goals in the UEFA European Championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer.[417] At the start of the tournament, Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal's draws against Iceland and Austria, despite taking 20 shots on goal. In the latter match, he overtook Figo as Portugal's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half.[418] With two goals in the last match of the group stage, a 3–3 draw against Hungary, Ronaldo became the first player to score in four European Championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament.[419][420] Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format,[421] despite not winning any of their games.[368] In Portugal's first knockout match, Ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia's goalkeeper Danijel Subašić into the path of Ricardo Quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time.[368] After his team progressed past Poland on penalties, with Ronaldo scoring Portugal's opening penalty,[368] he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals;[422] he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against Wales, equalling Michel Platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals.[423] In the final against hosts France, Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet, despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on,[368] he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma. During extra time, substitute Eder scored in the 109th minute to earn Portugal a 1–0 victory.[424] As team captain, Ronaldo lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first triumph in a major tournament. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.[425][426] Following the Euro 2016 success, Ronaldo played his first professional match on his home island of Madeira on 28 March 2017 at age 32, opening a 2–3 friendly defeat to Sweden at the Estádio dos Barreiros. With the goal, he tied with Miroslav Klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring European in international football.[427] In Portugal's opening match of the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup against Mexico on 17 June, Ronaldo set up Quaresma's opening goal in a 2–2 draw.[428] Three days later, he scored in a 1–0 win over hosts Russia.[429] On 24 June, he scored from a penalty in a 4–0 win over New Zealand, which saw Portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition; with his 75th international goal, Ronaldo also equalled Sándor Kocsis as the second-highest European international goalscorer of all time, behind only Ferenc Puskás.[430][431] He was named man of the match in all three of Portugal's group stage matches.[432] Ronaldo left the competition early; after Chile defeated Portugal 3–0 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children,[433] and missed Portugal's third-place play-off match in which Portugal defeated Mexico 2–1 after extra time.[434] On 31 August 2017, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 win in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match over the Faroe Islands, which saw him overtake Pelé and equal Hussein Saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals.[435] These goals brought his tally in the World Cup qualifiers to 14, equalling Predrag Mijatović's record for most goals in a single UEFA qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a European qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by David Healy and Robert Lewandowski. Ronaldo's hat-trick took his World Cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in UEFA qualifiers, ahead of Andriy Shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in World Cup qualifying and finals matches combined with 32 goals, ahead of Miroslav Klose.[436] Ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against Andorra in a 2–0 win.[437] On 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3–3 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. In doing so, he became the first Portuguese player to score a goal in four World Cups and one of four players of any nationality to do so.[438] On 20 June, Ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Morocco, breaking Puskás' record as the highest European goalscorer of all time, with 85 international goals.[439] In the final group match against Iran on 25 June, Ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1–1 draw which saw Portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind Spain.[440] On 30 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 2–1 defeat to Uruguay in the last 16.[441] For his performances in the tournament, Ronaldo was named in the World Cup Dream Team.[442] After the World Cup, Ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, but played for hosts Portugal in the inaugural Nations League Finals in June 2019. In the semi-finals on 5 June, he scored a hat-trick against Switzerland to reach the final. Upon scoring the opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record he previously shared with Ghana's Asamoah Gyan.[443] In the final of the tournament four days later, Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0.[444] On 10 September 2019, Ronaldo scored four goals in a 5–1 away win over Lithuania in a Euro 2020 qualifying match;[445] in the process, he overtook Robbie Keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the UEFA European Championship qualifying, setting a new record with 25 goals.[446] He also set a new record for scoring against the most national teams, 40,[447] while also completing his eighth international hat-trick.[448] On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2–1 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier.[449] On 17 November, Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal in a 2–0 win over Luxembourg, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2020.[450] On 8 September 2020, Ronaldo scored his 100th and 101st international goals in a 2–0 away win over Sweden in a 2020–21 UEFA Nations League match, becoming only the second male player ever to achieve this milestone (after Ali Daei of Iran) and the first in Europe.[451][452] On 13 October, the FPF announced that Ronaldo tested positive for COVID-19 while being asymptomatic.[453] By 30 October, Ronaldo had recovered.[454] On 15 June 2021, Ronaldo scored twice in Portugal's first game of Euro 2020, a 3–0 win against Hungary in Budapest.[455] This took him to a total of 11 European Championship goals, two clear of Michel Platini, as the all-time top goalscorer in the competition's history.[456] He also became the first player to score at five Euros,[457] and in eleven consecutive tournaments. The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition,[458] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[459] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals.[460] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[461] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[462] On 1 September, Ronaldo scored two headed goals, with his second coming seconds before the full-time whistle, in a 2–1 home win against the Republic of Ireland in a World Cup qualifier at the Estádio Algarve, which saw him pass Ali Daei to become the sole record holder by breaking the men's international scoring record with his 110th and 111th international goals.[463] On 9 October, he scored the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win over Qatar at the Estádio Algarve; with his 181st international appearance, he also overtook Sergio Ramos's record for the most international caps received by a European player.[464][465] In the following match against Luxembourg on 12 October, also played at the Estádio Algarve, Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 win for Portugal, and became the first player to score 10 hat-tricks in men's international football.[466] Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, making it his fifth World Cup. On 24 November, in Portugal's opening match against Ghana, Ronaldo scored a penalty kick and became the first male player to score in five different World Cups.[467] In the last group game against South Korea, Ronaldo received criticism from his own coach for his reaction at being substituted.[468] He was dropped from the starting line-up for Portugal's last 16 match against Switzerland, marking the first time since Euro 2008 that he had not started a game for Portugal in a major international tournament,[469] and the first time Portugal had started a knockout game without Ronaldo in the starting line-up at an international tournament since Euro 2000.[470] He came off the bench late on as Portugal won 6–1, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with Ronaldo's replacement Gonçalo Ramos scoring a hat-trick.[471] Portugal employed the same strategy in the quarter-finals against Morocco, with Ronaldo once again coming off the bench; in the process, he equalled Bader Al-Mutawa's international appearance record, becoming the joint–most capped male footballer of all time, with 196 caps. Portugal lost 1–0, with Morocco becoming the first CAF nation ever to reach the World Cup semi-finals.[472][473] Following the World Cup, despite having his future with the national team in doubt, after rumours of a possible omission by new manager Roberto Martínez, Ronaldo was named in Portugal's squad for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.[474] On 23 March, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 4–0 win over Liechtenstein; with his 197th international appearance, he overtook Al-Mutawa's record and became the most capped male footballer of all time.[475] On 20 June, Ronaldo made his 200th appearance for his national team, scoring the only goal of an away win over Iceland, in the Euro qualifiers, as he became the first player in the history of men's international football to make 200 appearances for his country.[476] On 13 October, Ronaldo scored a brace in a 3–2 win over Slovakia, leading Portugal to qualify for Euro 2024, marking the nation's fastest qualification to a major tournament in their history.[477] A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[478] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[479] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[480][481] such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[482] he has also been known to use the flip-flap.[483] His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[485][486][487] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[480][485] In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[485] He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[485] An accurate penalty kick taker,[488] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks.[489] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[490] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[491] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: ""People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.""[492] At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[494] Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[494][495][496] Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[497][498][499] This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a ""false"", ""attacking"", or ""goalscoring winger"", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[495][500] From 2013 onwards, under manager Carlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[494][501][502] Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[503][504][505] In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[506][507] On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[508][509][510] He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri.[507] ""In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player."" —Former manager Alex Ferguson, January 2013[511] Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Lionel Messi.[512] Winning his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[513] Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[514] he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[515] especially in important and high-pressured situations.[516] Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[517][518] On his longevity and ""extraordinary commitment to physical preparation"", Adam Bate of Sky Sports said: ""Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game.""[493] While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that ""there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it.""[519] His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring.[520] He is credited, along with his compatriot, coach José Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[521] At times, he has been criticised for simulating when tackled.[522] He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[523] Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to ""his relative immobility"" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[524] During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an ""arrogant image"" on the pitch,[525] with Ronaldo stating that he had become a ""victim"" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[526] He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[525] with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[526] His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[527][528][529] Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[530][531][532] After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a ""storming jump"" and ""turn"", before ""landing in spread-eagled fashion""[531] into his ""signature power stance"",[532] while usually simultaneously exclaiming ""Sí"" (Spanish and Italian for ""yes"").[530][533] This trademark celebration has been dubbed the ""Siu"" in the media.[530][531][534] Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[535] It has been compared to several sports rivalries, among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[536][537] Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[538] Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[539][540][541] ""It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."" —Ronaldo commenting on his rivalry with Messi.[542] In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: ""I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high.""[543] Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: ""I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best.""[544] Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was ""only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano.""[545] Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: ""We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players."" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: ""We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing.""[542] Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[546] In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013, when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming ""one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other."" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's ""commander"" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[547] In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: ""I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football.""[548] In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and ""gone"", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of ""sharing the stage"".[549] After Messi led Argentina to victory in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a number of football critics, commentators and players have opined that Messi has settled the debate between the two players.[550][551][552] As his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United, Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots; since November 2012, Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalised CR7 edition,[553] soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics, and video games.[554][555][556][557] Ronaldo was featured as the cover star of EA Sports' FIFA video game FIFA 18 and was heavily involved in the game's promotion.[558] His ""Sii"" goal celebration features in the FIFA series, accompanied with his own voiceover.[530] He was also the face of Pro Evolution Soccer, appearing on the covers of the 2008, 2012 and 2013 editions of the game.[559] With earnings of €720 million (£615 million) from 2010 to 2019, Ronaldo was ranked second in Forbes list of the decade's highest-paid athletes, behind boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr..[560] Forbes twice ranked Ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73 million in 2013–14 and $79 million in 2014–15.[561][562] The latter earnings saw him listed behind only Mayweather on the magazine's list of The World's Highest-Paid Athletes.[563] In 2016, he became the first footballer to top the Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16.[564] He topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93 million in 2016–17.[565] He is the first footballer and only the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career.[566] Ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable sportsmen: SportsPro rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012[567] and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with Brazilian footballer Neymar topping both lists.[567][568] Sports market research company Repucom named Ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in May 2014.[569] He was additionally named in the 2014 Time 100, Time's annual list of the most influential people in the world.[570] ESPN named Ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.[571][572][573][574] Ronaldo has established a strong online presence. The most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted over 500 million total followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram by February 2021, making him the first person to pass half a billion followers.[576] The most-followed person on Facebook (168 million), the most-followed on Instagram (615 million) and the most-followed sportsperson on Twitter (109 million), his sponsors earned $936 million in media value across his accounts between June 2016 to June 2017.[565] Ronaldo has released two mobile apps. In December 2011, he launched an iPhone game called Heads Up with Cristiano, created by developer RockLive,[577] and in December 2013, he launched Viva Ronaldo, a dedicated social networking website and app.[578] Computer security company McAfee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with Ronaldo's name first on the list.[579] Ronaldo has been the subject of several works. His autobiography, titled Moments, was published in December 2007.[580] His sponsor Castrol produced the television film Ronaldo: Tested to the Limit, in which he was physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was consequently subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in September 2011.[538] Cristiano Ronaldo: The World at His Feet, a documentary narrated by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, was released via Vimeo in June 2014.[581] A documentary film directed by Anthony Wonke about his life and career, titled Ronaldo, was released on 9 November 2015.[582][583] Demand for a replica Ronaldo shirt has been high throughout his career. In 2008, Ronaldo's number 7 Manchester United shirt was the best-selling Premier League sports product.[584] In 2015, Ronaldo's number 7 Real Madrid shirt was the second best-selling worldwide, after Messi's number 10 Barcelona shirt.[585] In 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 Juventus shirt being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.[586] Ronaldo opened a fashion boutique under the name CR7 (his initials and shirt number) on the island of Madeira in 2006 and opened a second in Lisbon in 2008.[587] In partnership with Scandinavian manufacturer JBS Textile Group and the New York fashion designer Richard Chai, Ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in November 2013.[588] He expanded his CR7 fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes in July 2014.[589][590] In September 2015, Ronaldo released his own fragrance, ""Legacy"", in a partnership with Eden Parfums.[591] In 2007, C.D. Nacional renamed its youth campus Cristiano Ronaldo Campus Futebol (Cristiano Ronaldo Football Campus).[592] In December 2013, Ronaldo opened a museum, Museu CR7, in his hometown of Funchal, Madeira, to house trophies and memorabilia;[593] the museum is an official sponsor of the local football team União da Madeira.[594][595] At a ceremony held at the Belém Palace in January 2014, President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva raised Ronaldo to the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry ""to distinguish an athlete of world renown who has been a symbol of Portugal globally, contributing to the international projection of the country and setting an example of tenacity for future generations.""[596] A bronze statue of Ronaldo, designed by artist Ricardo Madeira Veloso, was unveiled in Funchal on 21 December 2014.[597] In June 2010, during the build-up to the World Cup, Ronaldo became the fourth footballer (after Steven Gerrard, Pelé, and David Beckham) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London.[598] Another waxwork of him was presented at the Madrid Wax Museum in December 2013.[599] In June 2015, astronomers led by David Sobral from Lisbon and Leiden discovered a galaxy which they named Cosmos Redshift 7 (CR7) in tribute to Ronaldo.[600] On 23 July 2016, following Portugal's triumph at Euro 2016, Madeira Airport in Funchal was renamed as Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport.[601] The unveiling of the rebranded terminal took place on 29 March 2017, which included a bust of his head being presented.[602] The bust and the name change were controversial, with the lack of the bust's likeness to Ronaldo being ridiculed by comedians, including Saturday Night Live,[603] while the name change was subject to much debate locally by some politicians and citizens, who even started a petition against the move, an action criticised by President of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque.[604][602] A year later, sports website Bleacher Report commissioned sculptor Emanuel Santos to create another bust;[605] however, this bust was never used and a new one was made by a Spanish sculptor, shown to the public on 15 June 2018.[606] On 21 September 2020, the Sporting CP's football academy in Alcochete, until then called Academia Sporting, was renamed Academia Cristiano Ronaldo.[607][608] Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.[609][610] After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008, Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira.[611] In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[612] In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.[613] In 2012, Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer.[614] In December 2012, Ronaldo joined FIFA's ""11 for Health"" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction, HIV, malaria, and obesity.[615] In January 2013, Ronaldo became Save the Children's new Global Artist Ambassador, in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity.[616] In March 2013, Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia, an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation.[617] Ronaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[618] In June 2016, Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the competition.[618] In August, Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie, a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses.[619] Ronaldo has five children. He first became a father to a son, who was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[620] He has full custody of the child and has not publicly revealed the identity of the mother per an agreement with her.[621][622] In January 2015, Ronaldo's five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk ended.[623] Ronaldo became a father to twins,[624] born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy. He is currently in a relationship with Argentine-born Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez,[625] who gave birth to a daughter on 12 November 2017.[626] The couple expected a pair of twins in 2022. The male twin died during childbirth while the female twin survived.[627][628] Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[629] In January 2023, after Ronaldo moved to Saudi Arabia with his family having been signed by Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, the rulers of the Muslim-leaning Kingdom made Ronaldo an exception to the rule that unmarried couples are not allowed to live together in Saudi Arabia. An unnamed Saudi lawyer told Spanish news agency EFE that ""the laws of the Kingdom still prohibit cohabitation without a marriage contract"", but Saudi authorities have begun to ""turn a blind eye and stop prosecuting anyone, even though these laws are applied when there is a problem or a crime"".[630] Ronaldo is of Cape Verdean descent through his great-grandmother.[631] He is a Roman Catholic.[632] Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol,[611] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[633] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[634] In July 2017, Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014, a claim he denied at the time.[635] In June 2018, Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million, later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities. The sentence can be served under probation, without any jail time, so long as he does not re-offend.[636] Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women. Within days, the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution.[637] In April 2017, it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009.[638][639] Documents, confirmed by Ronaldo's lawyers, state that Ronaldo paid a woman US$375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement.[638][640] Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations, describing them as an ""intentional defamation campaign"" with parts significantly ""altered and/or completely fabricated"",[641][642] a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied.[643] In July 2019, Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape; the statement added: ""Based upon a review of information at this time, the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.""[644] The same woman, in September 2018, filed a civil lawsuit in Nevada accusing Ronaldo of rape.[645] The Daily Mirror, citing court documents, reported in 2021 that the woman sought £56 million in damages from Ronaldo.[646] In October 2021, federal magistrate judge Daniel Albregts recommended that the lawsuit be dismissed, citing that the woman's lawyer, Leslie Stovall, ""acted in bad faith by asking for, receiving, and using Football Leaks documents to prosecute"" the case, despite the documents containing ""privileged communications"" between Ronaldo and his lawyers. Additionally, Albregts stated that no evidence was found of Ronaldo's lawyers having ""intimidated [the woman] or impeded law enforcement"" during the 2010 settlement with her.[647] In June 2022, the woman's rape lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, as district judge Jennifer A. Dorsey ruled that Stovall's repeated use of ""cyber-hacked attorney–client privileged documents"" were actions representing ""abuses and flagrant circumvention of the proper litigation process"".[645][648] Notes Sporting CP[655] Manchester United[656][657] Real Madrid[657] Juventus[650] Al Nassr Portugal Individual Orders","Cristiano Ronaldo","[""Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro

"74544",":Article","  Alan Yelizbarovich Dzagoev (Russian: Алан Елизбарович Дзагоев, pronounced [ɐˈlan jɪlʲɪˈzbarəvʲɪdʑ dzɐˈgo(j)ɪf]; Ossetian: Дзӕгъойты Елизбары фырт Алан; romanized as Dzagoyev; born 17 June 1990) is a Russian former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. After joining Akademiya Tolyatti in 2006, he remained there for two seasons before transferring to CSKA Moscow. Following a successful debut season in the Russian Premier League, he won the award for Best Young Player in the league and made his way into the Russian national team. He is regarded as a star in his native North Ossetia.[2] Dzagoev has won 3 Russian Premier League titles and 4 Russian Cups. A full international for Russia since 2008, he was the joint top scorer at UEFA Euro 2012 and also played at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup. Dzagoev (born Zagoshvili[3]), the younger of two sons of Yelizbar (who is commonly referred to as Tariel) and Lyana, was born and raised in Beslan, North Ossetia–Alania, to which his family, ethnic Ossetians from Georgia,[2] moved in 1989.[4] He played football on the streets with his brother Gela right up to the second grade of elementary school, when their mother, a passionate football fan, brought them to the Terek Beslan youth team.[5] In 2000, Dzagoev moved to Vladikavkaz to play for a local youth team, Yunost. As their team used to attend Alania Vladikavkaz matches, he became their fan. He describes Valery Gazzaev, an Ossetic footballing legend who later became his coach at CSKA Moscow, as his childhood hero, also stating that Evgeni Aldonin and Frank Lampard were role models for him.[5] In July 2005, Dzagoev joined the Konoplyov football academy.[6] In July 2012, Dzagoev married Zarema Abayeva, who is originally from North Ossetia-Alania's capital, Vladikavkaz.[7] They have two children - Elana (born 2013) and Khetag (born 2016).[8][9] From January 2006 to December 2007, Dzagoev played for Akademiya Tolyatti, formerly known as Krylia Sovetov-SOK, of the Russian Second Division. He made his professional debut on 29 April 2006 in a 1–2 home defeat against Tyumen.[10] He appeared in 37 matches and scored six goals for the team.[citation needed] Dzagoev signed for CSKA Moscow before the start of the 2008 Russian Premier League season.[11] His first appearance was as a substitute in a match against Luch. A couple of games later, he appeared in the starting lineup in the home match against FC Khimki and managed to score a goal and two assists. He was also a starter when the team won the 2008 Russian Cup final. In the round 13 game against bitter rivals Spartak Moscow, Dzagoev made three assists, helping CSKA to secure a 5–1 victory and since then he has become an undisputed member of the first eleven. Dzagoev was also the man of the match when he scored two goals in a 1–3 away victory against UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg.[citation needed] At the end of the 2008 season, Dzagoev was chosen as Best Young Player of the Year by the Russian Football Union.[12] In October 2008, it was reported that Real Madrid were interested in signing the player, but it was not confirmed. In the 2008 season Dzagoev played 29 matches and scored 13 goals.[citation needed] Dzagoev scored from a very tight angle during a Champions League match against Manchester United on 4 November 2009, which finished 3–3.[13] In 2009 season he played 40 matches and scored 10 goals.[citation needed] On 2 December 2010, Dzagoev provided an assist for Sekou Oliseh and later added a cool finish as CSKA defeated Lausanne-Sports 5–1 in their penultimate group game, securing first place in Group F of the Europa League.[14] In the final group game against Sparta Prague on 15 December, Dzagoev scored the opening goal as CSKA dropped their first points of their European campaign, succumbing to a 1–1 draw.[15] On 24 September 2011, Dzagoev scored the winning goal of a 3–1 Premier League victory over Volga Nizhny Novgorod.[16] Three days later, Dzagoev scored a 45th-minute goal against Internazionale and a later strike from Vágner Love put the hosts level, until a late goal from Mauro Zárate gave the Italians a 3–2 victory.[17] Dzagoev provided the cross from which CSKA debutant Pontus Wernbloom netted the equalizer in their 1–1 draw against Real Madrid in their first leg Round of 16 clash on 21 February 2012.[18] In the 2012–13 season CSKA won the Russian Premier League title and Dzagoev was considered by some to be the best left midfielder.[19] In 2013/2014 season CSKA became the champion of Russian Premier League again and Dzagoev played 23 matches and scored 3 goals in all competitions.[citation needed] The 2015–16 season became one of the best in his career. On 21 May 2016 in the last match of Premier League with Rubin Dzagoev scored the winning goal and CSKA won another Russian Premier League title.[20] In this season he played 43 matches, scores 8 goals and 11 assists in all club competitions.[21] Dzagoev scored twice in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League group stage, against Bayer Leverkusen[22] and Tottenham Hotspur though the Moscow club exited Europe at this stage.[23] Having been sidelined with injury for much of 2017–18, Dzagoev returned to the CSKA side as a substitute in a Champions League match with FC Basel, scoring the goal at St. Jakob-Park.[24] On 21 June 2019, Dzagoev signed a new two-year contract with CSKA Moscow, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2021.[25] On 1 July 2021, Dzagoev's contract with CSKA expired. At the end of the same month, the possibility of extending the contract until the end of the 2022–23 season was announced. In the 2021–22 season, Dzagoev appeared in 20 matches and recorded 3 assists, and CSKA itself was not going to win medals again. In May 2022, information appeared that, despite the current contract, Dzagoev would leave the club at the end of the season. Dzagoev soon denied these reports.[26] On 20 May 2022, CSKA's official website confirmed the midfielder's departure at the end of the season.[27] On 2 September 2022, Dzagoev signed a contract until the end of the season with recently-relegated to Russian First League club Rubin Kazan, reuniting with his former manager at CSKA, Leonid Slutsky.[28] On 28 September 2023, after his contract with Rubin Kazan had expired, Dzagoev signed a one-year deal with Super League Greece club Lamia.[29][30] On 21 November 2023, Dzagoev announced his retirement due to persistent injuries.[31] After a string of impressive performances at club level, Dzagoev was called up to Russia squad for a 2010 World Cup qualification match against Germany scheduled for 11 October 2008.[32] He made his debut as a half-time substitute, at the age of 18 years and 116 days,[33] thus becoming the youngest outfield player ever to compete for Russia, and second youngest overall after goalkeeper and CSKA teammate Igor Akinfeev.[34] Dzagoev nearly earned the team a crucial away draw as he flicked the ball past Germany's goalkeeper René Adler, but hit the crossbar.[35] After the game, Russia manager Guus Hiddink stated, ""He's gelled into the team very well... Alan is a really clever player with the ability to make a killer pass and stretch the play. He proved that in Germany once again.""[36] Dzagoev himself, however, being unhappy with the defeat, labeled his debut ""a flop.""[36] He scored his first international goal on 8 October 2010 in a 2–3 away victory over the Republic of Ireland in the qualifying round of UEFA Euro 2012.[37] He was confirmed for the finalized squad for Euro 2012 on 25 May 2012.[38] Dzagoev scored two goals in Russia's opening game of the Euro 2012 tournament against the Czech Republic on 8 June 2012, a 4–1 victory,[39][40] in which he was named Man of the Match.[41] Dzagoev added his third goal of the tournament in his side's second game against Poland,[42] earning a 1–1 draw for his side.[43] With three goals scored, he finished the tournament as joint-top scorer, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Fernando Torres, Mario Gómez, Mario Balotelli, and Mario Mandžukić.[citation needed] On 2 June 2014, he was included in Russia's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup .[44] Dzagoev appeared as a substitute in all three of the team's matches as Russia were eliminated at the group stage.[citation needed] Dzagoev was included in Russia's squad for UEFA Euro 2016; however he withdrew due to injury on 22 May 2016.[45] He was excluded from the nation's squad for the FIFA Confederations Cup exactly a year later, again with an injury.[46] On 11 May 2018, he was included in Russia's extended 2018 FIFA World Cup squad.[47] On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad.[48] He featured in the opening match of the tournament against Saudi Arabia but was withdrawn through injury after just 24 minutes.[49] He recovered from injury to come on as a substitute in extra time against Croatia in the quarterfinals. He took a free kick that went brilliantly on to the head of Mariò Fernandes that was Russia's 2–2 equalizer with 5 minutes left to play in extra time. Dzagoev converted his shot in the eventual penalty shoot-out, but Russia lost to Croatia in the end of it.[50] Dzagoev is a playmaker, who ""enjoys playing behind the strikers"".[34] His main position is on the left side of midfield.[19] However, he is versatile, having also played ""on the right side of Russia's three-man attack"" in their win over the Czech Republic at EURO 2012 in which Dzagoev scored two.[51] In 2009, ESPN SoccerNet called Dzagoev ""one of the hottest prospects on the continent"", commenting that he is ""quick, good in the air and with exceptional technical skills"".[34] He has been recognised as the finest in the country in his position, being declared the best left-midfielder in 2013.[19] He was also named as Russia's ""star man"" by BBC Sport when they compiled their UEFA EURO 2012 team profiles.[52] When CSKA manager Leonid Slutsky was asked of Dzagoev following a goal against Tottenham Hotspur in 2016, he opined: ""it's obvious Alan Dzagoev is one of the top players in the Russian league"", adding that it was ""not surprising that scouts were watching him and it will not be surprising if he continues his career in one of the top British clubs"".[23] Shortly before the last round of international friendlies in the run-up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, The Guardian branded Dzagoev as one of ""three Russia players with the capacity to harm top-level opponents"".[53] International goals Individual","Alan Dzagoev","[""Alan Yelizbarovich Dzagoev"",""CSKA Moscow"",""Russian"",""Yunost"",""Russian Premier

"74545",":Article","  Mame Biram Diouf (born 16 December 1987) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays as a striker for Turkish TFF First League club Göztepe. Diouf started his career at Diaraf before moving to Molde in 2007. In his first season with them he won the Norwegian First Division, and gained promotion to the Norwegian top division. His performances and goalscoring attracted interest from a number of big clubs, and he eventually moved to Manchester United in 2009, remaining on loan at Molde until January 2010. He scored on his home debut for United and won the League Cup as an unused substitute in the 2010 final. Diouf joined Hannover in January 2012, where he scored 35 goals in 71 appearances, before moving to Stoke City on a free transfer in 2014. Diouf spent six seasons with Stoke scoring 25 goals in 157 appearances before leaving in the summer of 2020. Diouf made his Senegal debut in 2009 in a 2–1 friendly win over the DR Congo; he has represented the country at the 2015 and 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, as well as at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Born in Dakar, Senegal,[4] Diouf began his career with Diaraf. In January 2007, he joined Norwegian club Molde, having trained with them in March 2006. He expressed his happiness at joining fellow countrymen Pape Paté Diouf (still playing for a contract with Molde at that time) and Madiou Konate at the club. Molde also agreed with Diaraf all considitions concerning the transfer, if Diouf signed a professional contract with Molde.[citation needed] In his second season at Molde, and the first in Tippeligaen, Diouf did well and scored a total of five goals against Brann in the two matches of the 2008 season, two goals in a 4–3 victory in the Tippeliga match in Bergen on 31 May and three goals in the 8–0 victory in the Cup on 23 July.[5] These goals lead to some rumours in the Bergen-papers, that Brann would be interested in signing Diouf.[6] He was also linked to Arsenal, Feyenoord, Groningen, West Bromwich Albion and Red Bull Salzburg.[7][8] In the 2009 season, he scored 16 goals in 29 matches. Even with his strong performance, Molde only finished second in the league and the cup. A highlight of the season was the 5–2 win against Brann on 12 July 2009, where Diouf scored a hat-trick in the first nine minutes of the game, and added the fourth goal in the 27th minute.[citation needed] In May 2009, he received interest from several senior clubs and on 17 July 2009, Molde and Manchester United announced that a transfer had been agreed for the player.[9][10][11] Diouf was loaned back to Molde for the remainder of the Norwegian 2009 season, before joining his new teammates in Manchester in January 2010. ""We signed a young player yesterday from Norway, who we've been looking at for two years,"" United manager Alex Ferguson said. ""We weren't intending on signing anyone else after last week – we feel we have a full squad – but the situation accelerated to a point where other clubs started to make bids, so we had to decide whether we acted or didn't act. We decided to act and he'll be the last person we sign.""[12] On 23 December 2009, Diouf was granted a work permit making him available to play for Manchester United once the transfer window opened in January.[13] After becoming eligible to play for Manchester United on 7 January 2010, Diouf was registered with the number 32 shirt worn previously by Carlos Tevez,[14] and made his debut in a league match away to Birmingham City two days later; with the scores level at 1–1, Diouf came off the bench for Paul Scholes in the 81st minute, but he was unable to help break the deadlock and the match finished as a draw.[15] Diouf made his home debut for United in a 3–0 win over Burnley on 16 January 2010, coming on as a 74th-minute substitute for Wayne Rooney. In stoppage time at the end of the game, Diouf scored his first goal for United; after being played in by Antonio Valencia, he looped a header over Burnley goalkeeper Brian Jensen and celebrated with a flip in front of the Stretford End before pointing to the name on the back of his shirt.[16] On 6 August 2010, Diouf signed for Blackburn Rovers on a season-long loan and was handed the number 41 shirt.[17] Diouf made an immediate impact for Blackburn, scoring within 15 minutes after coming on as a substitute for Nick Blackman in a 1–1 pre-season friendly draw against Hearts.[18] On 24 August 2010, Diouf scored his first goals for Blackburn on his full debut as he netted a hat-trick in a 3–1 home League Cup victory over Norwich City, playing the full 90 minutes at Ewood Park.[19] He then scored his first league goal for Rovers four days later, netting their only goal in a 2–1 home loss to Arsenal on his first ever Premier League start; the assist came from his fellow Senegalese namesake El Hadji Diouf.

He came on for Michael Carrick in the second half of their first game, a 4–1 win over the New England Revolution. In the second game against Seattle Sounders, he came on at half time for Michael Owen and scored in the 49th minute, making it 2–0. The match finished 7–0 to Manchester United.

"74546",":Article","  Agustín Héctor Castro Rodríguez (29 November 1904 – 15 September 1960) was a Uruguayan football player and coach.[3] He scored Uruguay's first ever goal in a World Cup against Peru at the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 a tournament they would go on to win. Castro was born in Montevideo. When he was 13, he accidentally amputated his right forearm while using an electric saw, which gave origin to his nickname, El manco (meaning ""the one-armed"", or ""the maimed"").[4] In the 1933 Uruguayan Championship, Peñarol player Braulio Castro scored a controversial goal in the championship match where the ball clearly went out of play, but rebounded off a kinesiologist's medicine cabinet back into play in the build-up to the goal. This turned out to be the only goal of the game, and the opposition, Nacional, felt very hard done by, and three of their players were sent off, for assaulting the referee in annoyance at the goal. This meant that the referee, Telésforo Rodríguez, was unable to continue through injury, so one of the assistant referees, Luis Scandroglio, stepped in, and immediately abandoned the match due to bad light, after seventy minutes.[5] Over two months later, on 30 July, the League Board decided to disallow the goal, and also rescinded one of the three aforementioned sendings-off (that of Ulises Chifflet). They also ruled that the final twenty minutes would be played at Estadio Centenario, but behind closed doors to try to avoid the same controversy which had plagued the original encounter. The match went ahead behind closed doors, and there were no goals in the twenty minutes. In a highly unorthodox move, two sessions of extra-time were played (the usual allowance would be a single session), the score remained goalless.[5] Nacional's fans remember this game as the ""9 contra 11"" (""9 against 11"") since their team played the remaining 20 minutes plus both overtimes (totalling over 80 minutes) with nine players. A second playoff, which consisted of a standard match, followed once again by two sessions of extra-time, was played on 2 September, but still the deadlock wasn't broken.[5] A third playoff was contested on 18 November, and Héctor Castro played a vital role in this match, scoring a hat-trick which meant twice equalising as well as scoring the winning goal for Nacional, in a 3–2 win over Peñarol, which finally settled the Uruguayan Championship, almost six months after the controversial first playoff. This controversial playoff also meant that the Uruguayan Championship of 1933 was bizarrely not awarded until November 1934.[5] Castro made his debut for the Uruguay national football team in November 1923. He played his final match for la Celeste in August 1935 having played 25 times, scoring 18 goals.[6] Playing for Uruguay at the 1928 Olympic Games Castro won a gold medal.[7] Castro's goal in the World Cup Final helped Uruguay win the first FIFA World Cup in 1930.[7] He also scored the first ever goal at Estadio Centenario, against Peru, in that tournament. Castro played in South American Championship-winning teams in 1926 and 1935. Uruguay's goal tally first After retiring as a player, Castro worked as a football coach with Nacional. He won the Uruguayan championship in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, and again in 1952. Castro died in 1960 at the age of fifty five.

"74548",":Article","  Adam Edward Miller (born 19 February 1982) is a retired footballer. He began his career with Ipswich Town but failed to make the first team and played for several non-league teams before joining Queens Park Rangers, where he made his Football League debut in December 2004. He later joined Stevenage Borough, but followed manager Mark Stimson to Gillingham in late 2007. He represented the England National Game XI and played at Wembley Stadium in the final of the FA Trophy. Miller was born in Hemel Hempstead, but grew up in the Monkwick district of Colchester, where his family still lived as of 2004. He attended The Stanway School in the town.[2][3] At the age of 16 he joined Ipswich Town as a trainee.[4][5] At around the same time he was called up to represent Northern Ireland at under-18 level, qualifying by virtue of the fact that his maternal grandfather was born in the country.[6] Miller proved unable to break into Ipswich's first team and was permitted to undertake a trial with Southend United in August 2000. He played for the Essex club's reserve team,[7] which led to him being offered a professional contract, but Alan Little was dismissed as the club's manager shortly afterwards, and the offer of a contract was withdrawn.[8] In October 2000, Miller was released from his contract at Ipswich and dropped into non-league football, joining Canvey Island of the Isthmian League.[4] In the 2000–01 season he made 36 appearances for the ""Gulls"" and helped the team reach the final of the FA Trophy, although he was an unused substitute for Canvey's victory over Forest Green Rovers in the final.[9][10] The following season, he was a key member of the team that finished second in the Isthmian League Premier Division, playing 48 times in total.[11] In August 2002, after two final games for Canvey,[12] he moved to Grays Athletic in a swap deal which saw Jeff Minton go in the opposite direction.[4] Although he played 26 times for Grays in the 2002–03 season, scoring six goals,[13] he was made available for transfer at the end of the season.[14] He joined Gravesend & Northfleet in September 2003,[15] but played just four games for the club before moving on to Aldershot Town a month later.[16][17] His form at Aldershot won him The Non-League Paper's Young Player of the Year award for the 2003–04 season,[18] and also led to a call-up to the England National Game XI in February 2004, although it was to be his only cap for the semi-professional national team.[19] In November 2004, Miller played for Aldershot against the reserve team of Queens Park Rangers, the team he had supported since childhood.[20][21] Rangers manager Ian Holloway, who had received promising reports about Miller from scouts, was sufficiently impressed to sign the player after watching him in person.[22] Although the exact amount was undisclosed, the transfer fee was the highest ever received by Aldershot Town.[21] Miller made his Football League debut on 4 December 2004 in a 2–1 defeat to Nottingham Forest, and played in more than half of the team's remaining league matches that season.[23] By late September 2005, he had made just one league appearances since the start of the season,[24] and was sent to Peterborough United on what was originally intended to be a three-month loan.[25] A month later he was recalled to Loftus Road,[26] but he was not to feature again in the Rangers team.[24] In January 2006, he had a brief trial with Oxford United but the following week he joined Stevenage Borough of the Conference National, initially on an 18-month contract.[27] Miller featured regularly for Stevenage,[28] and was in the starting line-up for the 2007 FA Trophy final, the first competitive match at the new Wembley Stadium, in which Borough came back from two goals down to beat Kidderminster Harriers and win the Trophy.[29] Stevenage manager, Mark Stimson, was appointed as the new manager of Gillingham in November 2007,[30] and quickly moved to sign Miller and his teammate John Nutter on loan.[31] Miller made his debut for the Kent club in the 2–1 home win over Hartlepool United on 24 November 2007,[32] and signed a permanent contract in January 2008, set to keep him at the club until 2010.[33] During the team's ultimately unsuccessful struggle to avoid relegation from League One in the 2007–08 season, Miller was identified as a key player and singled out for praise by Stimson, who said ""If eight players play like Adam Miller we won't be in this position but if we've only got one or two we will be"".[34] The following season, he remained a regular selection in Stimson's team, acting as captain in Barry Fuller's absence,[citation needed] but injury kept him out of the team at the end of the season as Gillingham clinched a place in, and ultimately promotion through, the play-offs. In the 2009–10 season, however, he failed to hold down a regular place in the team, and in November 2009 went to Dagenham & Redbridge on a one-month loan.[35] Miller's debut for Dagenham came on 14 November in a 1–0 away win against Accrington Stanley.[36] He returned to Gillingham at the end of his loan spell, but Stimson announced that the club was considering paying off the remainder of the player's contract.[37] Despite this, Miller played regularly during the remainder of the 2009–10 season.[38] At the end of the season he left Gillingham and joined Cambridge United.[39] Miller played several times at the start of the 2010–11 campaign, but was seriously injured in early September against Eastbourne Borough.[40] Two years later, he announced his retirement from football as a result of the injury.[41] He subsequently set up a company leasing luxury cars to other footballers.[42]","Adam Miller","[""Adam Edward Miller"",""team"",""Mark Stimson"",""final"",""club"",""Queens Park

"74550",":Article","  Alan John Julian (born 11 March 1983) is a professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for National League South club Hampton & Richmond Borough. Julian started his career at Brentford, progressing through the club's academy and making his first-team debut in 2002. After failing to secure a place as Brentford's number one goalkeeper, he left to join Stevenage Borough in February 2005. Julian played regularly during his time at Stevenage, helping the club win the FA Trophy in May 2007. He left Stevenage to join Gillingham on a free transfer in May 2008. Julian was released by Gillingham in May 2011, having played 80 games for the club during his three-year tenure. He spent a season at his former club, Stevenage, before being released in May 2012, and subsequently joined Newport County a month later. He then signed for Dartford for the 2013–14 campaign and was named as the club's Player of the Year that season. After a brief spell at Conference South club Sutton United, Julian joined divisional rivals Bromley in January 2015. He helped Bromley achieve promotion to the National League in his first season with the club and spent the following two years playing regularly as the club consolidated their place in the top tier of non-League football. A move to Billericay Town of the Isthmian League Premier Division followed in February 2017. Julian played over 150 games during his three-and-a-half seasons at Billericay, helping the club to win promotion to the National League South. He signed for Hampton & Richmond Borough, also of the National League South, in September 2020. Julian joined Brentford aged nine, following a successful trial.[3] While also playing for Sunbury Manor and Sunbury Casuals,[4] he progressed through the various youth ranks and eventually signed his first professional contract in 2002.[3] He made his debut for the club in the Brentford's 1–0 victory over Plymouth Argyle in the Football League Trophy on 12 November 2002.[5] During the match, Julian was ""forced into numerous good saves. His best stop came in the 21st minute when he managed to claw away a stinging drive from Hasney Aljofree and moments later he also denied Blair Sturrock with a low block"".[6] He made a further three appearances during the 2002–03 season, keeping a clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Mansfield Town.[5] At the end of the season, Julian signed a new contract with Brentford, keeping him contracted to the club until 2005.[7] He made 14 appearances for Brentford during the 2003–04 season.[8] Julian left Brentford in February 2005,[9] claiming ""the time had come"" for him to experience first-team football on a regular basis.[3][10] He signed for Stevenage Borough on a free transfer on 4 February 2005,[11] making his debut in Stevenage's 1–0 win over Scarborough.[12] Julian kept seven clean sheets for Stevenage in 17 appearances during the second half of the club's 2004–05 campaign, including in a 1–0 victory against Hereford United at Edgar Street in the play-off semi-final second leg – a win that meant Stevenage were one game away from reaching the Football League for the first time in their history.[12][13] He played in the play-off final against Carlisle United at the Britannia Stadium, which Stevenage lost 1–0.[12] He remained at Stevenage during the 2005–06 season, ""attracting interest from scouts"" as a result of Stevenage's strong start to the season.[12][14][15] Stevenage kept 12 clean sheets during the season, although failed to make the play-offs following a 2–0 defeat at Forest Green Rovers,[12] finishing sixth.[16] Julian made 45 appearances for Stevenage during the campaign and was voted 'Supporters Association Player of the Year'.[12][17] At the end of the 2005–06 season, Graham Westley, the man that had brought Julian to Stevenage, left the club and was replaced by Mark Stimson.[18][19] Stimson signed goalkeeper Danny Potter and stated that Potter would be the club's first choice goalkeeper.[20] Julian was subsequently an unused substitute for Stevenage's first two games of the season.[21] However, after Potter was sent-off in Stevenage's home game against Crawley Town, Julian made his first appearance of the season, coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute in a 3–2 defeat.[22] Julian remained first choice goalkeeper from then onwards, making 53 appearances for the club during the 2006–07 season as Stevenage finished eighth in the Conference National.[12][23] Eight of Julian's appearances during the season came in the club's successful FA Trophy campaign, keeping four clean sheets in the process.[12] He also made a number vital saves in the club's semi-final second leg against Grays Athletic, which Stevenage went on to win by a 3–1 aggregate scoreline.[24] Julian started in the Final, which Stevenage won 3–2 against Kidderminster Harriers at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 53,262.[25] The win meant that Julian was part of the first team to win a competitive final at the new stadium.[25] Julian remained at Stevenage for a fourth consecutive season, starting in the club's first game of the 2007–08 season, a 2–1 defeat at Crawley Town.[12] He kept his first clean sheet of the season in Stevenage's 3–0 home win against Weymouth.[12] This served as the catalyst for a run of eight games without conceding a goal, equalling a Conference National record when they beat Farsley Celtic 4–0 at Broadhall Way.[26] Julian went a total of 778 minutes without conceding a goal.[12] After manager Mark Stimson left Stevenage to join Gillingham,[27] Julian refused to sign a new contract, stating he wanted to ""keep his options open for the summer"".[28] As a result, he was transfer-listed in January 2008.[28] Despite being on the transfer-list, Julian remained first choice goalkeeper under new manager Peter Taylor until Stevenage's 3–1 home defeat to Torquay United on 12 April 2008, his final appearance of the season.[12] He made 44 appearances during the 2007–08 season.[12] During his three and a half-year tenure at Stevenage, Julian made a total of 159 appearances in all competitions.[12] Julian joined Gillingham on a free transfer on 21 May 2008, joining up with former Stevenage manager Mark Stimson.[29] He made his debut for Gillingham in the club's League Cup first round 1–0 home defeat against Colchester United on 12 August 2008.[30] Four days later, Julian made his first league start for Gillingham, playing the whole match in a 1–0 home loss to Luton Town.[30] He did not make another first-team appearance until November 2008, when he kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win at Macclesfield Town.[30] A week later, he kept another clean sheet as Gillingham beat Bury 1–0 at Gigg Lane in the FA Cup.[30] After six weeks without a first-team appearance, Julian played in Gillingham's 2–0 away loss at Dagenham & Redbridge.[30] His next first-team appearance was five months later, playing in a 1–0 away victory at Rochdale, with Gillingham having already secured a play-off place.[30] It was Julian's last appearance of the 2008–09 campaign as Gillingham secured promotion back to League One after a 1–0 play-off Final win against Shrewsbury Town.[30][31] He made six appearances during his first season with the club, keeping three clean sheets.[30] Ahead of the 2009–10 campaign, manager Mark Stimson admitted he was undecided as to whether Julian or Simon Royce would start in the club's opening fixture of the season.[32] Julian ultimately started in the club's 5–0 home win against Swindon Town on the first day of the season.[33] After three straight defeats in the space of a week with Gillingham conceding seven goals,[33] Julian was replaced by Royce ahead of the club's League Cup game against Blackburn Rovers.[34] After the game, Julian only featured twice in the space of four months, both appearances coming in Football League Trophy fixtures.[33] Julian handed in a transfer request in November 2009 as a result of a lack of first-team appearances.[35][36] However, Gillingham received no offers for the player, with manager Mark Stimson saying ""I haven't had a phone call. He's been on the loan circuit for four to six weeks and I haven't had a call. You don't just say I'm on the transfer list and six teams come in for you"".[35] He remained at Gillingham and after appearing in Gillingham's 2–1 away loss at Huddersfield Town in December 2009, Julian remained as a first choice goalkeeper until the end of the season.[29][33] The club went the whole season without an away victory and were relegated back to League Two on the final day of the season following a 3–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers.[37][38] Julian made 33 appearances during the 2009–10 season, keeping eight clean sheets.[33] Under the new management of Andy Hessenthaler,[39] Julian started the 2010–11 season as first choice goalkeeper, starting in the club's first game of the season, a 1–1 draw with Cheltenham Town on 7 August 2010.[40] However, similarly to the 2009–10 season, Julian lost his first-team place after a winless run at the start of the campaign.[40] New signing Lance Cronin impressed in an away draw against Morecambe,[41] and kept Julian out of the first-team for five weeks.[42][43] After Gillingham's 7–4 away loss at Accrington Stanley,[44] Julian regained his first-team place, playing in a 2–1 home win against Stockport County on 9 October 2010.[40] Julian was part of the side that ended Gillingham's 35 game winless away streak when they won 1–0 against Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium on 20 November 2010, making a number of key saves during the game.[45] He remained as first choice goalkeeper throughout the season as Gillingham finished in eighth position in League Two,[40] narrowly missing out on a play-off place after losing three out of their last four games.[46] Julian made 41 appearances for Gillingham in all competitions during the 2010–11 season, keeping 12 clean sheets.[40] Despite being the club's first choice goalkeeper during the campaign, Julian was told that he no longer featured in the club's plans,[10] and was subsequently released on 11 May 2011.[47] He made 80 appearances in all competitions for Gillingham during the three years he spent at the club.[48] In June 2011, Julian re-joined his former club, now renamed Stevenage, on a free transfer, three years after leaving the club.[49][50] The move meant that Julian would be playing under the management of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said ""Alan sees the opportunity in the long term and we all know how much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with"".[49] On signing for Stevenage, Julian said ""I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back now and we are in League One, it is a dream come true"".[51] As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger,[52] Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City.[53] He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury.[53] Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town.[53] He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.[54] In June 2012, Julian joined Conference Premier club Newport County on a free transfer.[55] In Newport's first pre-season game ahead of the 2012–13 season, away to Caldicot Town, Julian suffered a knee ligament injury.[56][57] He subsequently missed the first three months of the season, before eventually making his first-team debut for Newport on 17 November 2012, in a 3–1 home defeat to Hyde.[58] Julian went on to make 11 appearances during a campaign in which Newport would return to the Football League after a 25-year absence following the club's 2–0 play-off final victory over Wrexham in May 2013.[58][59] He was released by Newport at the end of the season, and subsequently signed for Dartford.[60] On securing the signing of Julian, Dartford manager Tony Burman stated, ""After meeting Alan a couple of times, I was impressed with his professionalism and I am looking forward to having someone of his experience here at Dartford.""[61] Julian was voted Dartford's player of the season for the 2013–14 season. Following his departure from Dartford, Julian signed for Sutton United. However, following an injury in pre-season, Julian found opportunities limited, before eventually making 14 league appearances.[58] He eventually left the club along with fellow goalkeeper Tom Lovelock in January 2015. Soon after, he joined Sutton's league rivals Bromley.[62] He made his debut for the club in a 2–1 away win over Basingstoke Town.[58] On 16 February 2017, Julian joined Billericay Town.[63] On 19 October 2019, in an FA Cup fourth qualifying round match against his former club Sutton United, Julian scored an injury-time goal to earn his side a 1–1 draw and a replay.[64][65] Julian is eligible to play for Northern Ireland due to his grandfather, John Julian Sr, being born in Belfast.[4] After being capped at U18 and U19 level, he played once for the Northern Ireland U21 side, playing in a 0–0 draw against Switzerland U21 in August 2004.[66] Julian was born at Ashford Hospital.[4] He is a Chelsea supporter.[4] Stevenage Newport County Bromley Billericay Town Individual","Alan

She spent summer 2006 playing in the W-League with New York Magic.[7] Bassett left Birmingham for Arsenal in 2008.[8] She signed for Leeds Carnegie in October 2009[9] and helped the Yorkshire club win the Premier League Cup in February 2010.[10] After Leeds' funding and FA WSL bid collapsed, Bassett spent a period without a club.[11] In October 2010 it was revealed that she had re-signed for Birmingham City.[12] In April 2012 Bassett was appointed as one of eight digital media ambassadors, one from each team, who wear their Twitter account name on their shirt sleeves to raise the profile of the WSL.[13] At the end of the 2013 season, club captain Bassett rejected Birmingham's offer of a new contract and joined Chelsea.[14] With Bassett Chelsea finished as runners-up in the 2014 FA WSL, but she signed a three-year contract with Notts County ahead of the 2015 campaign.[15] Following Notts County's folding in April 2017,[16] Bassett became a free agent. She joined Australian club Canberra United for the 2017–18 Australian W-League season.[17] Bassett sat out the 2018–19 season to give birth to her daughter Saede. On 3 June 2019 she announced her retirement.[18][19] Bassett was part of the BBC's commentary team for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.[20] Bassett represented England at youth level,[5][7] including at the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship. When she made her senior debut against Italy in February 2003,[21] she became the first Birmingham City Ladies player to play for England at full international level.[22] In May 2009, Bassett was one of the first 17 female players to be given central contracts by The Football Association.[23] She made her FIFA Women's World Cup debut in July 2011, replacing Ellen White for the final minute of England's 2–0 group B win over Japan.[24] Bassett scored a last-minute equaliser in England's opening UEFA Women's Euro 2013 match against Spain, but Karen Bardsley's injury time own goal gave the Spanish a 3–2 win.[25] Under new coach Mark Sampson, Bassett started England's first game at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, a 1–0 defeat by France. She sustained a black eye after being elbowed in the face by Camille Abily, but the French player controversially escaped any punishment.[26] During added time in the semi-final match against Japan, Bassett lobbed the ball into England's goal while trying to clear it to prevent Japan from taking an open shot, resulting in a 2–1 defeat.[27] She captained England for their UEFA Women's Euro 2017 first phase match against Portugal,[28] her last appearance for England. She was allotted 146 when the FA announced their legacy numbers scheme to honour the 50th anniversary of England’s inaugural international.[29][30] Bassett is in a long-term relationship with Manchester United Women manager Marc Skinner, having met while both coaching for Birmingham's U-14s team.[31] Their daughter, Saede, was born in December 2018.[32] Birmingham City England","Laura

Rabiot was born in Saint-Maurice, Val-de-Marne.[6] He played youth football for several teams, including two spells at Créteil-Lusitanos and a few months at Manchester City.[7][8] On 2 July 2012, after excelling at the Camp des Loges, he signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Paris Saint-Germain.[9] Rabiot was promoted to the senior team by manager Carlo Ancelotti ahead of the 2012–13 season.[10] In the club's pre-season he started in the penalty shootout defeat to Barcelona,[11] and, on 26 August, played his first game in Ligue 1, a 0–0 home draw against Bordeaux.[12] Rabiot made his UEFA Champions League debut on 6 November 2012, playing during injury time in a 4–0 group stage home win over Dinamo Zagreb.[13] In January of the following year he was loaned to fellow league side Toulouse,[14] scoring his first professional goal on 9 March 2013 which was the game's only goal at Brest, from 25 yards.[15] Returning to PSG, Rabiot contributed with 46 matches and six goals[16][17] combined as the team won back-to-back domestic leagues from 2013 to 2015, but seemed to be on the verge of leaving the club as his mother Véronique acted as his main advisor during negotiations for a better contract.[18][19] He started the 2015–16 campaign by getting sent off for two yellow cards after only 29 minutes, in the opening fixture against Lille (eventual away 1–0 win).[20] Rabiot scored his first goal in European competition on 25 November 2015 to open a 5–0 Champions League group win at Malmö,[21] and repeated the feat the following 9 March in a 2–1 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, putting PSG into the quarter-finals 4–2 on aggregate.[22] Four days later, he scored in a 9–0 routing at bottom team Troyes that sealed the league title with eight matches remaining.[23] On 23 April 2016, Rabiot was sent off in the final of the Coupe de la Ligue, a 2–1 win over Lille.[24] The following two seasons combined, he scored four times from 60 appearances and conquered the national championship in 2017–18.[25][26] In late October 2018, both Rabiot and Kylian Mbappé were dropped from the starting XI by newly appointed manager Thomas Tuchel after they arrived late to a pre-match meeting.[27] The following January, after refusing to renew his contract and failing to appear for the first team since the previous month, the former midfielder was forced to train with the reserves.[28] On 14 March 2019, Rabiot was suspended by PSG until the end of the month for going to a nightclub after a 3–1 loss to Manchester United in the Champions League round of 16 which knocked them out of the competition, and for liking an Instagram post by Patrice Evra celebrating United's win.[29] On 1 July 2019, Rabiot signed for Italian Serie A champions Juventus on a free transfer.[30] He made his debut for the club on 24 August, in the team's opening match of the 2019–20 Serie A season, coming on as a second-half substitute for Sami Khedira in a 1–0 away win over Parma.[31] He scored his first goal for the club on 7 July 2020 – the opening goal in a 4–2 away loss to Milan in Serie A – with a ""spectacular finish from the edge of the box – after running with the ball from his own half.""[32][33] On 9 March 2021, he scored his first Champions League goal with Juventus in a 3–2 win after extra-time against FC Porto in the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League round of 16; however, Juventus were eliminated on away goals.[34] On 27 June 2023, he signed a one-year contract extension with the club until 2024.[35] On 30 December, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Roma.[36] Rabiot was a member of the France U19 side that reached the final of the 2013 UEFA European Under-19 Championship in Lithuania, losing out to Serbia.[4][5] On 13 August 2013, aged just 18, Rabiot made his first appearance for the French under-21 team, starting in a 0–0 friendly draw with Germany in Freiburg.[37] He was on stand by for the full side's UEFA Euro 2016 squad,[38] but did not make the final cut.[citation needed] Rabiot made his senior debut for France on 15 November 2016 against Ivory Coast, starting and being replaced by Thomas Lemar after 78 minutes of the 0–0 friendly home draw, due to a hamstring injury.[39][40] On 17 May 2018, he was put on the reserve list by manager Didier Deschamps for the 2018 FIFA World Cup squad.[41] However, he controversially refused to be put on the standby list, emailing the coach and saying he would not ""be able to follow the training programme"". Noël Le Graët, president of the French Football Federation, commented: ""He made a bad decision. He penalises himself and sanctions himself alone.""[42] On 18 May 2021, Rabiot was included in France's 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020.[43] He came on as an emergency left back in the final group game against Portugal due to injuries to Lucas Hernandez and Lucas Digne, and retained a starting role as a left wing back in an untested 3–5–2 formation against Switzerland in the last 16;[44] his side lost in a penalty shootout after a 3–3 draw.[45] On 13 November, Rabiot scored his first international goal in an 8–0 home win over Kazakhstan, which allowed France to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[46] On 22 November 2022, playing against Australia, Rabiot scored France's first goal of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[47] He is a complete player, I have rarely seen someone so strong both physically and technically. — Andrea Pirlo[48] A tall, strong, and elegant left-footed midfielder, who combines good technique with impressive physical qualities, Rabiot was regarded as a promising player in his youth. He is known for being mobile, hard-working, quick in possession, and for his ability to make late attacking runs off the ball into the penalty box, courtesy of his intelligent movement; he is also a composed passer, who possesses good link-up play and dribbling skills in close spaces, which enables him to create chances for teammates. A modern, well-rounded, and versatile player, with good defensive skills, he is also known for being capable of playing in several different midfield positions, including in a deep, creative holding role as a number 6 in front of the defence (which is not his favoured role, however), as a box-to-box midfielder, on the right flank, and even as an advanced midfield playmaker, although he usually plays as a left–sided offensive-minded central midfielder, known as the mezzala role in Italian football jargon, which is his preferred position. His Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri has also deployed him as a left winger on occasion. Despite his talent and ability, however, he has come under criticism in the media over his behaviour off the pitch, and has also been accused in the media of lacking professionalism, as well as having a poor attitude and a difficult character, which has led him to have conflicts with several of his managers.[30][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56] Paris Saint-Germain[30] Juventus France U19 France

Born in Escobedo de Villafufre, Cantabria, Ruiz played for local Racing de Santander and Gimnástica de Torrelavega, ending his career at the age of 28 to become a full-time coach. At the age of 15 he had his first experiences as a manager, and often accumulated duties whilst still an active footballer;[1] his first professional spell was with the former club in the 1967–68 season, being relegated from Segunda División. In the following years, Ruiz worked extensively in youth football,[2] being charged with FC Barcelona's cantera in the 70s/80s[3] as well as the Generalitat of Catalonia's youth facilities. In the 1975–76 campaign he was in charge of the former's first team for six La Liga games, taking the place of German Hennes Weisweiler.[4] He managed three wins – including one at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium against Real Madrid on 30 April 1976 (2–0) – two draws and one loss during his spell, as the Catalans finished in second position; he was replaced by Rinus Michels in the summer, but continued working with the club. Ruiz's other managerial stints with the professionals were with UP Langreo (1971–72, second level, relegation), FC Barcelona B (1976–77, division two, relegation) Celta de Vigo (1978–79, top flight, relegation)[1] and former team Racing Santander (1979–80, second tier, 16th position).","Laureano Ruiz","[""Laureano Ruiz Quevedo"",""manager"",""club"",""Spanish"",""Racing de Santander"",""Cantabria"",""Escobedo de Villafufre"",""Gimnástica de Torrelavega"",""footballer"",""age"",""age"",""manager"",""coach"",""UP Langreo"",""career"",""experiences"",""duties"",""spell"",""youth football"",""former"",""cantera"",""place"",""team"",""youth facilities"",""season"",""wins"",""charge"",""games"",""relegation"",""one"",""level"",""professionals"",""Generalitat of Catalonia"",""FC Barcelona"",""Segunda División"",""campaign"",""relegation"",""relegation"",""position"",""La Liga"",""Real Madrid"",""Santiago Bernabéu Stadium"",""German"",""Hennes"",""flight"",""FC Barcelona B"",""spell"",""position"",""stints"",""loss"",""draws"",""Celta de Vigo"",""Catalans"",""Rinus Michels"",""2"",""77"",""1975"",""30 April 1976"",""1971"",""1976"",""1978"",""1979"",""21 October 1937"",""1937"",""1"",""2"",""0"",""70"",""76"",""1967"",""1976"",""79"",""21"",""4"",""72"",""15"",""80"",""3"",""16"",""three"",""one"",""1978"",""1975"",""30"",""1979"",""68"",""80"",""six"",""one"",""28"",""1971"",""two"",""two"",""1"",""1976"",""1967""]","0.0022581402008504097","true","[0.6242519,0.048873294,0.028490376,0.025677565,0.01545365,0.014103714,0.012397569,0.012397569,0.0098667545,0.00904734,0.0090024825,0.0090024825,0.008453011,0.0083177835,0.007950245,0.007910804,0.007910804,0.006873325,0.0066404827,0.0061520785,0.006132728,0.0057135937,0.005612207,0.0053880387,0.0053411033,0.0049305568,0.0049305568,0.0049305568,0.0046276404,0.0037413705,0.0037081991,0.0037081991,0.0036275215,0.0036275215,0.0035958926,0.0033272093,0.0032399814,0.0032399814,0.0029552532,0.002915665,0.002915665,0.002915665,0.002915665,0.002915665,0.0025958621,0.0021922407,0.001855831,0.001855831,0.0016465111,0.0016300248,0.0016300248,0.0015342664,0.001096698,9.6321077E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Laureano Ruiz - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laureano_Ruiz",,,,,,,
"74559",":Article","  Ole Gunnar Solskjær KSO ( Norwegian pronunciation: [ˈûːlə ˈɡʉ̂nːɑr ˈsûːlʂæːr] ⓘ; born 26 February 1973) is a Norwegian professional football manager and former player. He was most recently the manager of Premier League club Manchester United. He played as a forward. As a player, Solskjær spent the majority of his career with Manchester United and also played 67 times for the Norway national team. Solskjær began his career in his native Norway with Clausenengen, for whom he scored 115 goals in 109 league appearances over five seasons, helping them earn promotion to the Norwegian Second Division in 1993, before moving to Molde, newly promoted to the Tippeligaen, for the 1995 season. His goals helped Molde to a second-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Cup. He joined Manchester United in July 1996 for a transfer fee of £1.5 million. Nicknamed ""the Baby-faced Assassin"", he played 366 times for United and scored 126 goals during a successful period for the club. He was regarded as a ""super-sub"" for his knack of coming off the substitute bench to score late goals. In added time at the end of the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, he scored the winning last-minute goal against Bayern Munich, with Manchester United having trailed 1–0 as the game passed 90 minutes, and winning the treble for United. He remained a regular player for the side until a serious knee injury sustained in 2003 permanently plagued his playing career.[3][4] Failing to recover from the injury, Solskjær announced his retirement from football in 2007.[5] Solskjær remained at Manchester United in a coaching role as well as in an ambassadorial capacity. In 2008, Solskjær became the club's reserve team manager. He returned to his native country in 2011 to manage his former club, Molde, whom he led to their two first-ever Tippeligaen titles in his first two seasons with the club. He secured a third title when his team won the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup Final. In 2014, he served as manager of Cardiff City, during which the club was relegated from the Premier League. In late 2018, Manchester United appointed Solskjær as caretaker manager, taking over from José Mourinho for the rest of the 2018–19 season.[6] On 28 March 2019, having won 14 of his 19 matches in charge, Solskjær signed a three-year contract to take over as Manchester United manager on a permanent basis.[7] He took Manchester United to the 2021 UEFA Europa League final, where they lost to Villarreal on penalties. He was sacked by the club in November 2021 following a poor run of performances during the 2021–22 season.[8] Solskjær was born in Kristiansund, Møre og Romsdal[2] to Øyvind, a Greco-Roman wrestling champion,[9] and Brita Solskjær.[10][11] At the age of seven, he joined local football club Clausenengen,[12] who were in the 3. divisjon.[13] Solskjær supported Liverpool as a child.[9] Between the ages of eight and ten, he followed in his father's footsteps and trained as a Greco-Roman wrestler, but gave it up due to being tossed around too much.[14][10] Between 1992 and 1993, Solskjær completed a mandatory year's national service in the Norwegian Army.[14][15] Solskjær debuted for Clausenengen (CFK) at 17 years old in 1990.[16] He participated in the Otta Cup, scoring seventeen goals in six matches. On 21 May 1993, CFK faced Molde in the Norwegian Football Cup, with Solskjær scoring Clausenengen's only goal in their 6–1 defeat.[17] Clausenengen were promoted to the 2. divisjon in 1993, winning the 3. divisjon by 12 points.[18] Solskjær's final season at the club was in 1994, with him scoring 31 of CFK's 47 goals,[16] helping the club achieve a mid-table finish of sixth place.[19] In Solskjær's five years playing for Clausenengen, he averaged more than a goal a game in the league, scoring 115 goals in 109 matches.[16] On 14 February 1995, ahead of the start of the new season, he was signed by Åge Hareide, manager of newly promoted top-flight club Molde, for a fee of NOK150,000.[20] On 22 April 1995, Solskjær made his debut for Molde against Brann, scoring twice in a 6–0 victory.[21][22] In his second game on 29 April, Solskjær scored a hat-trick helping Molde 5–4 win over Viking.[21][22] On 14 May, he scored another brace in a 2–1 win over Hamarkameratene.[21][22] Two days later, he netted a hat-trick as Molde thrashed Hødd 7–2.[21][22] Solskjær scored a penalty in Molde's 4–1 victory over Strindheim on 30 July.[23][22] On 10 August, Solskjær played in his first European competition, the qualification round for UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, against Belarusian team Dinamo-93 Minsk.[23] Molde conceded in the first half but Solskjær managed to equalise in the 85th minute.[24] He also scored in the second leg as Molde won 2–1 (3–2 on aggregate) and qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup proper.[25] Molde were subsequently drawn against French team Paris Saint-Germain, Solskjær scored in the first leg on 14 September as the team lost 3–2 at Molde Stadion.[26] He played in the away leg on 28 September, but Molde were outmatched and lost 3–0.[27] Molde finished the season in second place, runners-up to Rosenborg by 15 points.[28] In Solskjær's first season at Molde, he scored 20 goals in 26 matches in the 1995 Tippeligaen.[29] Solskjær also formed a good strike-partnership with fellow forwards Arild Stavrum and Ole Bjørn Sundgot; because their surnames all started with the same letter, this led to them being referred to as ""The Three S's"".[21][30] Solskjær began the 1996 Tippeligaen in defeat, losing 2–0 to Rosenborg.[31] However, in his next match on 21 April 1996 against Moss, he scored a hat-trick as Molde won 8–0.[31] He scored a brace against Tromsø on 19 May in a 3–0 victory,[31][32] and his goal-scoring form led to interest from Hamburg of Germany and Italian club Cagliari.[33] Molde's then-manager, Åge Hareide, made Solskjær available to both Everton and Hareide's old club Manchester City for £1.2 million.[33] However, neither Everton nor City were willing to take a risk on Solskjær, and the interest from Hamburg and Cagliari fell through after Manchester United submitted a bid of £1.5 million during Euro 1996, which Molde accepted.[33] Solskjær made his final appearance for Molde on 21 July 1996 in a 5–1 win against Start, scoring the fourth goal in the 85th minute, before throwing his shirt to the crowd in celebration and receiving applause as he was substituted.[34] He finished his time at Molde with 41 goals in 54 games in all competitions.[34] Solskjær joined Manchester United under Alex Ferguson on 29 July 1996, and was something of a surprise acquisition as he was almost unknown outside his homeland and at the time United were still in the hunt for Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer, who then joined Newcastle United for a world-record £15 million.[35] As the only striker to arrive at Old Trafford that year, it was widely expected that his first season would be spent as a backup to Eric Cantona and Andy Cole with only occasional first-team opportunities. However, within weeks of his arrival it was clear that he would be a key part of the first team sooner than had been anticipated, and would also prove himself to be one of the biggest Premier League bargains of the season.[36] He was issued with the number 20 shirt for the 1996–97 season, a squad number he would retain for the rest of his Manchester United career. He scored six minutes into his debut as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers on 25 August 1996, after replacing David May in the 64th minute.[37] Solskjær made his first start on 14 September in a 4–1 win against Nottingham Forest, scoring United's first goal in the 22nd minute.[38] On 25 September, he netted his first European goal for Manchester United in their 2–0 win over Rapid Wien, opening the scoring in the 20th minute.[39] He scored his first brace for United against Tottenham Hotspur on 29 September, scoring the only goals of the game in the 38th and 58th minutes.[40] On 21 December, Solskjær scored his second brace of the season as United beat Sunderland 5–0, scoring in the 35th and 48th minutes.[41] The Norwegian started in both of United's UEFA Champions League semi-final matches against Borussia Dortmund, which United lost 2–0 on aggregate to the eventual winners.[42][43] He scored his third brace on 3 May 1997 against Leicester City in a 2–2 draw, netting in the 45th and 51st minutes.[44] United clinched the title after Newcastle drew away at West Ham on 6 May, thus Solskjær won his first Premier League title.[45] Solskjær scored 18 Premier League goals in 33 appearances (25 of which were starts) for United in his first season – the club's top goalscorer for that campaign.[46] The British media nicknamed him ""the Baby-faced Assassin"" because of his youthful looks and his deadly finishing.[47] Solskjær scored his first goal of the 1997–98 season on 24 September 1997 in a 2–2 draw against Chelsea, equalising in the 86th minute after coming off the bench 20 minutes earlier.[48] On 1 November, he scored a brace against Sheffield Wednesday during a 6–1 victory at Old Trafford, netting in the 41st and 75th minutes.[49] Solskjær got his second brace on 30 November, scoring in the 18th and 53rd minutes of United's 4–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers.[50] On 24 January 1998, he scored his third brace of the season in a 5–1 win against Division Two team Walsall in the FA Cup fourth round, adding the second and fourth goals in the 35th and 67th minutes.[51] Solskjær started in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg at Old Trafford against Monaco on 18 March (with the aggregate score at 0–0).[52] David Trezeguet opened the scoring for Monaco inside five minutes, before Solskjær levelled in the 53rd minute, but United failed to score again and were knocked out on away goals.[53] Manchester United's match against Newcastle on 18 April would become a defining moment of Solskjær's career. The match was tied at 1–1, and Manchester United needed at least a draw to keep up with Arsenal in the race for the league title, with Solskjær being introduced in the 79th minute.[54] Near the end of the game, Newcastle's Rob Lee had a clear goalscoring opportunity, running unopposed towards United's goal, but Solskjær had run across the entire field to commit a professional foul against him, thus denying Newcastle a winning goal. Solskjær did this knowing he would be sent off, and suspended for the coming matches. Supporters regarded this as an example of how Solskjær put the club above personal interest.[55] The Norwegian only managed six league goals in 22 appearances (15 starts) during his second season at the club,[56] and despite his sacrifice against Newcastle, Arsenal beat Manchester United to the league title by a single point.[57] Solskjær stayed at Old Trafford even though other clubs showed interest in the player in 1998. He refused an offer from Tottenham Hotspur, after Manchester United had accepted a £5.5 million bid for him.[58] He scored his first goals of the 1998–99 campaign in a 4–1 victory over Charlton Athletic on 9 September 1998, netting in the 38th and 63rd minutes.[59] On 11 November, Solskjær put two past Nottingham Forest in a 2–1 win, helping United advance to the fifth round of the League Cup.[60] He scored his third brace of the season against Tottenham Hotspur on 12 December, scoring in the 11th and 18th minute of an eventual 2–2 draw.[61] After again turning down a move away from Manchester United, this time to West Ham,[62] Solskjær came on in the 81st minute of Manchester United's FA Cup fourth round tie against rivals Liverpool on 24 January with United 1–0 down at the time;[63] shortly after Dwight Yorke's equaliser, Solskjær scored the winning goal in injury time.[64] On 6 February, Solskjær came off the bench in the 71st minute during United's 8–1 win over Nottingham Forest and went onto to score four goals in the last 12 minutes of the match.[65] This has been described as one of his most impressive feats.[55] Manchester United sealed the Premier League title on 16 May, the last day of the season, against Tottenham Hotspur after coming from behind to win 2–1,[66][67] with Solskjær winning his second Premier League title in three years.[68] Solskjær started in the 1999 FA Cup final against Newcastle on 22 May, playing the whole match as United won 2–0 and completed the double.[69] On 26 May, Manchester United faced German team Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final at Camp Nou.[70] Mario Basler scored from a free kick in the sixth minute putting Bayern ahead.[71] With United still trailing, Teddy Sheringham was introduced in the 67th minute, while Solskjær was brought on for Andy Cole in the 81st minute.[71] Sheringham scored the equaliser at precisely 36 seconds into stoppage time, and shortly after the following kick-off United forced a corner.[70] David Beckham took the corner kick, finding Sheringham who headed the ball across the goal, it then being poked into the roof of the net by Solskjær (the goal being timed at 90+2:17').[72] The Norwegian's winning goal helped the team secure the Treble and cemented his own place in United folklore.[citation needed] Solskjær finished the season with 12 league goals in 19 games (9 starts).[73] Solskjær scored his first goal of the 1999–2000 season on 11 August 1999, netting in the 84th minute in a 4–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday.[74] On 2 November, he scored a sublime volley during a 2–1 victory against Austrian team Sturm Graz in the UEFA Champions League.[75] Solskjær won the Intercontinental Cup on 30 November, as Manchester United beat Brazilian team Palmeiras 1–0 at the National Stadium in Tokyo, Japan.[76] On 4 December, he put four goals past Everton in a 5–1 victory at Old Trafford, the second of which was Solskjær's 50th goal for the club in all competitions.[77] Solskjær equalised for United against Liverpool in a 1–1 draw on 4 March 2000.[78] Three days later, he came off the bench in the 83rd minute against Bordeaux, scoring a minute later from goalkeeper Raimond van der Gouw's long ball.[79][80] Manchester United won the Premier League on 1 April after thrashing West Ham 7–1, with Solskjær getting the seventh in the 73rd minute.[81][82] On 15 April, he scored a brace during a 4–0 victory over Sunderland, netting in the 2nd and 51st minutes.[83] Four days later, Solskjær featured in the second leg of United's UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid, but failed to score as United were knocked out 3–2 on aggregate.[84][85] On 24 April, he equalised against Chelsea bringing the score to 2–2, with United going on to win 3–2.[86] He ended the campaign with 12 league goals in 28 appearances (15 starts).[87] Solskjær's opportunities were limited at the start of the 2000–01 season, however he scored on his second start of the season on 16 September 2000 as United beat Everton 3–1.[88] On 31 October, he netted a brace during a 3–0 victory against Watford in the League Cup third round, scoring in the 12th and 81st minutes.[89] He scored another brace on 23 December, against Ipswich Town in a 2–0 victory.[90] Three days later, Solskjær helped United snatch a 1–0 win against Aston Villa, with the Norwegian heading in a David Beckham cross in the 85th minute.[91] Solskjær scored the first goal of United's 2–1 FA Cup third round win over Fulham on 7 January 2001.[92] On 25 February, he netted Manchester United's fifth goal against Arsenal (their closest title rivals) in United's 6–1 demolition,[93] which sent them 16 points clear at the top of the table.[94] On 10 April, he scored the winning goal in United's 2–1 victory over Charlton Athletic, scoring only six minutes after coming on in the 76th minute.[95] Manchester United wrapped up the Premier League title in April – their third consecutive title, and Solskjær's fourth.[96][68] That season Solskjær scored 10 league goals in 31 appearances (19 starts).[97] After a few years of coming on as the super-sub, Solskjær got a chance as a starter in the 2001–02 season, paired up with Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. He took the opportunity with characteristic incisiveness, forcing Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke onto the bench.[citation needed] He scored his first goals of the season on 22 September 2001, in a 4–0 victory over Ipswich Town, with Solskjær netting two – the second from a difficult angle.[98] On 23 October, Solskjær came off the bench in the 73rd minute against Olympiacos, with the score level at 0–0, and within six minutes broke the deadlock – helping United eventually win 3–0.[99] Four days later, he came off the bench while United were 1–0 down against Leeds United, and snatched an equaliser in the 89th minute – heading in a Ryan Giggs' cross.[100] On 12 December, he scored a brace and provided two assists in United's 5–0 victory over Derby County, netting in the 6th and 58th minutes while setting up Roy Keane and Paul Scholes.[101][102] Solskjær started the comeback against Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on 6 January 2002, scoring in the 77th minute, as well as providing the assist for van Nistelrooy's second goal as United won 3–2.[103] On 29 January, he scored a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers in Manchester United's 4–0 win.[104] Solskjær netted a brace against Charlton Athletic in United's 2–0 win on 10 February, scoring in the 33rd and 74th minutes.[105] On 26 February, Solskjær's 29th birthday, he scored his fourth brace of the season against French team Nantes as United won 5–1.[106][107] He scored yet another brace on 30 March, putting two past Leeds United as 'the Red Devils' won 4–3.[108] Solskjær helped Manchester United advance to the UEFA Champions League semi-final after scoring two against Deportivo La Coruña in United's 3–2 victory on 10 April, the first only two minutes after coming on.[109][110] He started against Arsenal at Old Trafford on 8 May, but failed to score as 'the Gunners' beat United 1–0 and won the Premier League.[111][112] Solskjær finished the season with 17 league goals in 30 appearances (23 starts), his best tally since his debut season at the club.[113] By the 2002–03 season, both Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke had left Old Trafford, leaving Solskjær, Diego Forlán and Van Nistelrooy to compete for a place in the starting line-up. Ferguson's persistence in playing Van Nistelrooy up front with Paul Scholes, or as a lone striker, meant that opportunities were limited.[citation needed] Solskjær scored Manchester United's first goal of the season on 17 August 2002, netting the winning goal (his 100th in all competitions) against West Bromwich Albion in the 78th minute.[114][115] On 19 October, he earned a point for United in a 1–1 draw against Fulham, equalising in the 61st minute.[116] Solskjær was subsequently given his time again when David Beckham picked up an injury and Ferguson played the Norwegian on the right wing. While proving himself to be an able crosser of the ball, Solskjær also continued to contribute with goals, scoring a total of 16 goals in the season. He was selected to play on the right in important matches, such as in the league game against Arsenal and the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid, while Beckham was left on the bench. He also captained the team in a number of matches.[citation needed] At the start of 2003–04, Solskjær found himself as United's first-choice right winger. However, a knee injury suffered against Panathinaikos on 16 September 2003 put Solskjær out of action until February 2004. Solskjær returned from the injury for the season run-in and was man of the match in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Arsenal. He also played in the 2004 FA Cup final, which the club won. Solskjær was forced to undergo intensive knee surgery in August 2004 and had to miss the 2004–05 season entirely.[citation needed] To show their continuing support, United fans added a banner to the collection that lines the Stretford End reading ""20 LEGEND""[117][better source needed] (Solskjær wore number 20 for United). Solskjær further solidified his status amongst United fans when he became a patron of the supporters action group, Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST), previously Shareholders United.[citation needed] Solskjær made his long-awaited return to action on 5 December 2005, playing for United's reserves against Liverpool.[118] Spectators numbering 2,738 showed up to witness the comeback of the popular Norwegian – an above-average turn-out for a reserve team match. He made his first-team return as a substitute in the match against Birmingham City on 28 December. He then finally made his first start in January 2006 in an FA Cup match against Burton Albion, before playing a full game as a captain in the third round replay. His return to full fitness slowly continued with regular appearances in the reserves, until on 8 March 2006 when, during a game against Middlesbrough, he was accidentally caught by Ugo Ehiogu, breaking his cheekbone. While facing the possibility of missing the rest of the season,[119] he nevertheless appeared as a substitute against Sunderland on Good Friday. Solskjær had a successful pre-season tour in the summer of 2006 gaining Ferguson's praise who also said he would reconsider his plan to buy a new striker.[120] He returned to Premier League action on 23 August 2006 when he scored in an away match against Charlton Athletic, his first Premier League goal since April 2003. Ferguson commented after the match that ""it was a great moment for Ole, United fans everywhere, the players and the staff"" and that ""Ole has been through a torrid time with injuries for the last two years, but he's persevered and never lost faith and has got his repayment tonight. Everyone is over the moon for him."" He continued his come-back by putting in the winning goal in the Champions League group match against Celtic at home on 13 September, fulfilling his post-injury ambition to score another goal at Old Trafford. Solskjær's first Premier League goals at Old Trafford since his return came on 1 October when he scored both goals in the 2–0 win against Newcastle United. His goalscoring form continued when he started in the away match against Wigan Athletic and struck a sublime finish to round off a 3–1 victory, and again against Crewe Alexandra on 25 October 2006, scoring the first goal in a 2–1 away victory in the third round of the League Cup. After a further injury sustained in Copenhagen in the UEFA Champions League, Solskjær recovered and again returned to form scoring the third goal in a 3–1 home win over Wigan on Boxing Day. Solskjær continued his form by scoring United's opening goal in their 3–2 home win over Reading on 30 December. Additionally, he came on as a substitute to score an injury-time winner in the 2–1 victory over Aston Villa at home in the FA Cup third round on 7 January 2007.[citation needed] After scoring in the away FA Cup fifth round replay match against Reading on 27 February, Solskjær had further surgery on his knee. However, it was not as serious as his previous operations, and he was out of action for only a month. He was predicted to be available for the home game against Blackburn Rovers on 31 March. United manager Ferguson said: ""It was good timing with the international break coming up. It gave us the opportunity to get the thing done."" Solskjær did make his comeback against Blackburn Rovers as a late substitute, and even scored in the 89th minute to seal Manchester United's 4–1 win. His last match was the 2007 FA Cup final against Chelsea, but he had to settle for an FA Cup runners-up medal, as an extra-time goal from Didier Drogba gave Chelsea the victory.[citation needed] On 5 June 2007, it was announced that Solskjær had undergone minor surgery after he reported discomfort in his knee while training with Norway. The surgery was a success, but Solskjær failed to fully recover and announced his retirement from professional football on 27 August 2007. On 4 September, at a home game against Sunderland, Solskjær walked onto the pitch to say goodbye to the fans and received a standing ovation.[121] As of his retirement, Solskjær held the record for the most goals scored for Manchester United as a substitute, scoring 28 goals off the bench,[122] as well as the most Premier League goals as a substitute with 17,[123] a mark which has since been passed by Jermain Defoe.[124] On 2 August 2008, a testimonial match was played in honour of Solskjær at Old Trafford against Espanyol. Almost 69,000 fans were present, setting a record as the second-highest-attended testimonial in British history.[125] United eventually got the winner from substitute Fraizer Campbell. Solskjær appeared in the 68th minute, replacing Carlos Tevez.[125] At Manchester United, Solskjær earned wide acclaim for a habit of coming into matches late on as a substitute and scoring goals.[126][127][128] Ferguson remarked that Solskjær had a knack of sitting on the bench and studying the game without taking his eye off the action. Reflecting on this aspect of his career years later, Solskjær said: ""I had to think about myself, how can I do the most damage for the opposition if I come on? I sat there and I studied football games but I didn't exactly analyse their strikers. [...] Instead I would pay attention to what the defenders and full-backs were doing wrong.""[129] Solskjær made his international debut in a friendly match against Jamaica on 26 November 1995, just a few months before he joined Manchester United. The game finished in a 1–1 draw with Solskjær scoring the only goal for Norway. He continued his great goal scoring start by scoring three goals in his first competitive appearances for the national team during the 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign.[citation needed] Solskjær played in both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 for Norway. He formed a feared partnership with Tore André Flo which was seen as one of the best striking partnerships in Norway's history.[citation needed] Following his lengthy layout to injuries Solskjær made his full game comeback on 2 September 2006, when he scored the first and last goals in a 4–1 win against Hungary in a Euro 2008 qualifying match. They would be his last goals for the national team taking his tally up to 23 goals.[130] On 7 February 2007, Solskjær made what proved to be his final appearance for Norway in a 2–1 defeat against Croatia, he finished with a total of 67 appearances for his country.[131][132] Solskjær signed his last player contract with Manchester United on 31 March 2006, with a provision to allow him to develop his coaching credentials. He also acted in an ambassadorial role for the club, when he travelled to Hong Kong in 2006 and played with students at the Manchester United Soccer School there. When interviewed by Setanta Sports in August 2007, Solskjær confirmed he would train to be a coach after retiring from professional football, and would start to earn the required badges after his last season with Manchester United. Following his retirement, Solskjær worked for Ferguson at Old Trafford, coaching the strikers on the first team for the remainder of the 2007–08 season.[133] As announced on 20 May 2008, he took over the Manchester United Reserves during that summer. Solskjær was United's first full-time reserve team manager since 2006, taking over from Brian McClair and Jimmy Ryan, who had filled the role in a caretaker capacity. He won the 2007–08 Lancashire Senior Cup by defeating the Liverpool Reserves 3–2 in the final.[134] On 12 May 2009, Solskjær won his first Manchester Senior Cup by defeating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at the Reebok Stadium.[135] Shortly after the resignation of Åge Hareide as coach for the Norwegian national team, Solskjær was offered the position but he declined, saying that it was not yet the right time for him.[136] Solskjær's final game as Manchester United Reserves manager was a 5–1 victory over Newcastle United on 16 December 2010.[137] On 9 November 2010, Solskjær signed a four-year contract with the Norwegian club Molde to take over as manager, where he played prior to moving to Manchester United.[138] Solskjær continued as Manchester United Reserves manager until January 2011, when he took over at Molde for the start of the new season.[139] On 18 March 2011, Molde played their first league game under Solskjær and suffered an embarrassing 3–0 defeat to newly promoted Sarpsborg 08. They played their first home game of the season on 3 April, where despite coming from 1–0 down to lead 2–1 they were held to a 2–2 draw by league leaders Tromsø. Molde's first goal under Solskjær was scored in this game, by Senegalese striker Pape Paté Diouf. On 17 April 2011, Solskjær won his first Tippeligaen game at Molde with the 3–2 home win over Stabæk. On Molde's 100 years anniversary on 19 June 2011, Solskjær led the team to a 2–0 victory over Sogndal and the top of the Tippeligaen. On 30 October 2011, Solskjær won the Tippeligaen with Molde in his first year as manager for the team.[140] On 18 May 2012, Molde gave Aston Villa permission to discuss their vacant managerial role with Solskjær, following the sacking of Alex McLeish.[141] However, Solskjær decided to remain with Molde to avoid disrupting his family after they had settled back in Norway.[142] On 11 November 2012, Solskjær's team, Molde, won the Tippeligaen for the second consecutive year after they beat Hønefoss 1–0, whilst their closest title challengers, Strømsgodset lost 2–1 away to Sandnes Ulf.[143] In 2013, Molde suffered a tough season opening with only 7 points in the first 11 matches. Under the guidance of Solskjær, Molde managed to recover and at the end of the season the team finished in sixth place with 44 points in 30 matches. On 24 November 2013, Molde beat Rosenborg 4–2 in the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup Final to win the Norwegian Football Cup for the third time in the club's history, thus securing a place in the 2014–15 Europa League qualifiers.[144][145] On 2 January 2014, Solskjær was announced as manager of Cardiff City.[146] The club won its first game with Solskjær in charge, coming from behind to beat Newcastle United 2–1 in the third round of the FA Cup, two days after his appointment.[147] Cardiff then struggled for points and after defeats against Swansea City,[148] Hull City,[149] Crystal Palace[150] and Sunderland,[151] were relegated back to the Championship following a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle.[152] At the end of the season, Cardiff finished 20th, collecting only 7 wins and 30 points. He departed on 18 September 2014 following Cardiff City's poor run of form at the start of the Championship campaign.[153][154] On 21 October 2015, Solskjær returned to Molde, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract to become their new manager.[155] His first match back in charge was the next day, with Molde defeating Celtic 3–1 at home in the Europa League group stage.[156] His first game in the league was a 2–1 away win against Aalesunds on 25 October.[157] He won the next, and final, two games of the 2015 Tippeligaen against Viking and Start, with Molde finishing in sixth.[158][159] Meanwhile, in the Europa League group stage, Solskjær guided Molde to first place, ahead of Fenerbahçe, Ajax and Celtic.[160] On 14 December, Molde was drawn against the title holders and eventual champions Sevilla in the Round of 32.[161] Molde lost the away leg 3–0 on 18 February 2016 but won the home leg 1–0 on 25 February, getting knocked-out 3–1 on aggregate.[162][163] The 2016 Tippeligaen started fairly well for Solskjær with Molde winning seven, drawing three and losing two games in the first 12 matches with Molde sitting in second place. However a bad stretch of form followed with Molde failing to win their next six games, losing five of them – including a 3–1 defeat to league leaders Rosenborg on 28 May 2016.[164] Molde then won the next four games, including a 4–2 victory over Odd on 21 August with two goals coming in stoppage time from substitutes Tobias Svendsen and Harmeet Singh.[165] In Solskjær's first full season back as manager, Molde finished fifth in the league after losing on the final day of the season 1–0 to Lillestrøm.[166] Molde's initial form under Solskjær in the 2017 Eliteserien was mixed with the club winning their first two matches – including a stoppage time winner against Lillestrøm on 5 April 2017[167] – but after that they only won one of their next seven games leaving Molde in tenth. Form improved however with Molde only losing just once in the next nine games, winning six including two 3–0 victories against Tromsø and Aalesund, bringing the club up to third place.[168][169] After losing the next two matches, Molde went unbeaten for the next seven games, winning six with two last minute victories against Odd and Vålerenga – seeing Molde go second.[170][171] Solskjær reached the semi-final of the Norwegian Football Cup on 17 August after a 2–1 victory over Kristiansund.[172] The match took place on 21 September with Molde losing 3–0 to Lillestrøm, who went on to win the Cup.[173] Solskjær helped Molde finish second in his third season, seven points behind winners Rosenborg, seeing the club qualify for the first qualification round of the Europa League.[174][175] The 2018 Eliteserien was Molde's best year under Solskjær since his return, starting the season with three wins against Sandefjord, Haugesund and Tromsø sending Molde top.[176][177][178] After a 4–0 defeat against Rosenborg on 8 April 2018,[179] Molde's form began to vary with the club getting only three wins in the next eight matches leaving the club in eighth. However Solskjær oversaw Molde go undefeated over the next five games including: a 4–0 away win over Brann on 1 July;[180] a 5–1 victory against Vålerenga on 8 July;[181] and a 5–1 win against Brann on 12 August.[182] On 11 July, Molde played away against Northern Irish side Glenavon in the first qualifying round of the Europa League, losing 2–1.[183] Molde won the return leg 5–1 on 19 July, sending them through to the next qualification round.[184] Molde were then drawn against Albanian team Laçi, beating them 5–0 on aggregate.[185][186] For the third qualifying round, Molde faced Hibernian over who Solskjær led his team to a 3–0 win on aggregate.[187][188] Molde were drawn against Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg on 6 August,[189] who they faced on 23 August with Molde losing 3–1 away.[190] Solskjær's Molde won the return leg on 30 August 2–1 but it was not enough as Molde were knocked out 4–3 on aggregate.[191] After suffering defeats in the league to Stabæk and Ranheim at the end of August,[192][193] Solskjær led his side undefeated for the rest of the season – winning eight out of ten. His best win in this run was against title challengers Rosenborg on 30 September, who Solskjær beat 1–0.[194] Despite this it was not enough as Molde finished the league in second place, five points behind winners Rosenborg. On 3 December 2018, Molde announced that Solskjær extended his contract till the end of the 2021 season.[195] Manchester United appointed Solskjær as caretaker manager on 19 December 2018, taking over from José Mourinho for the rest of the 2018–19 season.[6][196] He was scheduled to return to Molde in May 2019, with his assistant coach Erling Moe acting as caretaker manager during Solskjær's absence in the pre-season and the first matches of the 2019 Eliteserien, which was scheduled to start on 31 March 2019.[197] Solskjær later suggested that he would need to sign a new contract with Molde if he were to return,[198] but this was refuted by Molde director Øystein Neerland, who expected Solskjær to return to Molde at the end of the English season.[199] Solskjær's first match was against his former club, Cardiff City, on 22 December 2018, with United finishing as 5–1 winners.[200] This was the first time United had scored five or more goals in a Premier League game since a 5–5 draw with West Bromwich Albion in Ferguson's final game in charge before his retirement in May 2013.[201] Victories in his next four league games made Solskjær the first Manchester United manager to win his first five league games in charge since Sir Matt Busby in 1946.[202] The league winning streak was ended at six (eight in all competitions, including FA Cup wins over Reading at home and away at Arsenal) after United played out a 2–2 draw at home to Burnley on 29 January.[203] Solskjær's successful first full month as Manchester United manager resulted in him being named as the Premier League Manager of the Month for January 2019, during which time his team earned 10 points from a possible 12 in the league, making him the first Manchester United manager to win the award since Ferguson in October 2012 and the first Norwegian to be named either Player or Manager of the Month.[204] Two consecutive away wins in the league against Leicester City and Fulham gave United six consecutive away victories in all competitions for the first time since May 2009, and sent them into the top four of the league table. Having picked up 25 points since taking over, Solskjær earned more points than any other manager has managed in his first nine games in charge of a single club in the Premier League.[205] A 3–1 win at Crystal Palace on 28 February 2019 set a club record of eight consecutive away victories in all competitions.[206] The Champions League saw Solskjær suffer his first loss as manager, as United were beaten 2–0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their round of 16 tie on 12 February.[207] In the second leg at the Parc des Princes on 6 March, a Marcus Rashford penalty in the 94th minute gave Manchester United a 3–1 win, sending them through to the quarter-finals on away goals and making them the first team in the history of the European Cup to advance after losing the first leg at home by two goals or more.[208] On 10 March, United lost 2–0 to Arsenal, their first Premier League defeat under Solskjær, dropping out of the league's top four.[209] On 16 March, United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2–1 quarter-final defeat, with Solskjær commenting that this was United's worst performance yet under his management.[210] On 28 March 2019, having won 14 of his 19 matches in charge, Solskjær signed a three-year contract to take over as Manchester United manager on a permanent basis.[7][211] After Solskjær gained this permanent role, United won only 2 of 10 matches for the rest of the season.[212] This included defeats in both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona in April 2019, going down 4–0 on aggregate, in which Solskjær admitted Barcelona were a ""couple of levels above"" United;[213] a 4–0 league defeat away to Everton, also in April 2019;[214] and in United's final game of the season in May 2019, they lost 2–0 at home to already-relegated Cardiff, Solskjær's former club.[215] United finished the Premier League season in sixth place, the same position they were when Solskjær joined as caretaker manager.[215] United finished five points behind the fourth placed team, and 32 points behind the first placed team that season. Solskjær declared in late May 2019 that United had ""a big job preparing for next season with player logistics and training logistics"", but the club would be ""ready"" when the next season started, and there were ""not going to be any excuses"".[216] Under Solskjær, United started the 2019–20 season with 10 points from their first nine games, their worst start to a league campaign in 33 years (since the 1986–87 season).[217] By January 2020, they lost 2–0 to Burnley at Old Trafford, leaving United with a league record of 34 points from 24 games, which was worse than the previous season's tally at that point.[218] In that match, United's players were booed by their own fans; vitriolic chants were directed at the Glazers, United's owners, and vice-chairman Ed Woodward by fans; and thousands left Old Trafford before the final whistle. Former United player Darren Fletcher commented that ""the atmosphere [at Old Trafford] really turned toxic for the first time"". Solskjær stated that the ""players are giving everything"", and called for fans to ""stick together"" to ""help the club to move forward"".[219][220] Also that month, United were knocked out of the EFL Cup at the semi-final stage after losing 3–2 on aggregate over two legs to Manchester City.[221] After new United signing Bruno Fernandes made his debut, United went unbeaten for the rest of the Premier League season, with 32 points from 14 games since February 2020, more than any other club in that period.[222] CNN described United as ""a team lacking creativity, quality and leadership"" producing ""poor"" football before Fernandes' arrival, but ""signs of new life under Solskjaer"" emerged by the end of the season, with Fernandes a key spark.[218][223] United finished the season with 66 points in the Premier League, equal to the previous season's points tally, but now in third place instead of sixth.[224] Solskjær declared that the third-place league finish was a ""massive achievement"", ""with this team and this squad, and where we have been with this rebuild"".[225] With United finishing the league 33 points behind Liverpool and 15 behind Manchester City, Solskjær stated it would be a ""massive challenge"" to outdo these teams the next season.[226] Late in the season, United were knocked out of two more competitions at the semi-final stage. In the FA Cup, United suffered a 3–1 loss to Chelsea; Solskjær dropped usual FA Cup goalkeeper Sergio Romero in favour of David de Gea, but the latter made two errors leading to two Chelsea goals.[227] In the Europa League, the last game of United's season saw United succumbing to a 2–1 loss to Sevilla. Solskjær did not make any substitutions until the 87th minute of the game, and again dropped usual Europa League goalkeeper Romero in favour of de Gea. Solskjaer had said before this game that ""semi-finals are not good enough for Manchester United""; after the game Solskjaer reacted: ""when you don't take the chances it's going to be hard"", United's players had ""tired legs and tired minds"", and that United ""definitely need to improve"".[228][229] Under Solskjær, United had a slow start to the 2020–21 Premier League season, starting the campaign with a 3–1 loss to Crystal Palace at home and scoring seven points from their first six league games, placing them 15th in the league table. This included a 6–1 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur in October, United's joint heaviest defeat in the Premier League, that saw Solskjær stating it was the worst day of his managerial career; as well as a 1–0 home loss to Arsenal in November, which was Solskjær's 100th match in charge of United, where Solskjær reacted by saying that United's players ""didn't turn up"".[230][231] Meanwhile, in the Champions League, United were knocked out in the group stage when they finished third in their group, with one win and one loss against each of their opponents, Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and İstanbul Başakşehir. This result sent United into the Europa League. Back in the Premier League, after eight wins in 10 Premier League games, United travelled to Burnley on 12 January 2021 and won 1–0. This put United at the top of the league table after 17 league games, which was the first occasion this happened since the 2012–13 title-winning season under Sir Alex Ferguson.[232] The Guardian commented that United exemplified ""unerring determination"" in this game, which was ""a theme of United's season"" so far.[233] However, United were soon caught by Manchester City, and with a 2–1 home loss to bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United on 27 January 2021, failed to regain the top spot. While BBC Sport described United as ""desperately poor"", Solskjær suggested that United were unlucky since United had been the ""most consistent team"" that season, and stating that there ""will be no big inquest"" into the loss.[234] Since the Sheffield United loss, United went on a 14-match unbeaten run in the league.[235] On 2 February, Solskjær oversaw United scoring a record equalling nine goals in a 9–0 victory over Southampton as the latter team received two red cards. It was the third time such a feat had been achieved in the Premier League, with Manchester United being first to do so against Ipswich in 1995.[236] On 9 May, United came from behind to nail a 3–1 away win against Aston Villa, thus confirming a top-four finish to the season and Champions League qualification. With this victory, United set a record of winning 10 league matches that they conceded first in within a season.[237] On 11 May, United's unbeaten run was ended by Leicester City with a 2–1 loss at Old Trafford, after Solskjær drastically changed his starting line-up due to fixture congestion after United were scheduled to face Villa,Leicester and Liverpool in the space of five days between 9 May 2021 and 13 May 2021 after United's fixture with Liverpool was postponed due to 2021 Old Trafford protests. This result handed Manchester City the Premier League as United could no longer mathematically catch them.[235] Manchester United finished runners-up in the Premier League with 74 points, 12 points behind champions Manchester City, and qualified for the Champions League group stage. This was United's first back-to-back top-four finish since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.[238] In the EFL Cup, United were eliminated in the semi-final in January 2021 by Manchester City with a 2–0 home loss. In the FA Cup, despite knocking out Liverpool in the fourth round in a 3–2 win at Old Trafford in January 2021, United were later knocked out by the eventual winners Leicester City in the quarter-final in March 2021 with a 3–1 away loss. In the Europa League, United eliminated Milan in the round of 16 with an aggregate win of 2–1 over two legs in March 2021, then later eliminated Roma in the semi-finals with an aggregate win of 8–5 over two legs. In the Europa League final on 26 May, United lost 11–10 on penalties to Villarreal after a 1–1 draw.[239] Solskjær was criticised by some fans for his decision to make his first substitution 10 minutes into extra time.[240] On 24 July 2021, Manchester United announced that Solskjær had signed a three-year contract extension until 2024, with an option for a further year, till 2025.[241] United kicked off their 2021–22 UEFA Champions League campaign on 14 September 2021 with a 2–1 loss to Swiss club Young Boys, Cristiano Ronaldo scored early on. However, United would be down a man after Wan-Bissaka got sent off, allowing Young Boys to come back to win the game 2–1 with a late goal. In the Premier League, United started off strong with a 5–1 win at home vs Leeds with Bruno Fernandes scoring a hattrick and Paul Pogba registering four assists in that game. United would go on to get 13 points in their opening five games. Under Solskjær, on 19 September, Cristiano Ronaldo and Jesse Lingard scored goals in Manchester United's 2–1 win over West Ham United at the London Stadium to set a new record for being unbeaten in 29 away games in the Premier League.[242][243] A run of poor results started on 25 September with a 1–0 loss at home to Aston Villa. This preceded a one all draw at home vs Everton and a 4–2 loss at Leicester that ended their unbeaten away run. On 24 October, Solskjær oversaw a 5–0 home loss to arch-rivals Liverpool; United's worst result against Liverpool since 1925.[244] On 6 November, they lost 2–0 in the Manchester derby against rivals Manchester City. On 20 November, after losing 4–1 to Watford and conceding 15 goals in their last five league fixtures, it was reported the club's board of directors held an emergency meeting and decided to sack and part ways with Solskjær and label the departure of Solskjær as mutual consent.[245] On 21 November, Manchester United confirmed that Solskjær had left his role as manager.[246] At the time of his departure, Manchester United were seventh in the Premier League table with 17 points after 12 games and United had only one win in the last seven games Solskjær managed. First-team coach and former player Michael Carrick took over as caretaker until Ralf Rangnick's appointment in December as interim manager until the end of the season. Erik ten Hag took over as permanent manager ahead of the 2022-23 season. During his time as a player for Manchester United, Solskjær lived in Bramhall with his wife, Silje, and their three children, Noah, Karna and Elijah. Two of the children are footballers: Noah plays as a midfielder,[247] while Karna plays as a forward for AaFK Fortuna and is a product of the Manchester United academy.[248] She made one senior appearance for United, debuting in the 2021–22 Women's FA Cup against Bridgwater United, in doing so she and Ole became the first father-daughter pair to play for Manchester United.[249] On 24 October 2008, Solskjær was awarded the First Class Knighthood of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav by King Harald V of Norway.[250] He was presented with the award in a ceremony the next day in his hometown of Kristiansund.[251] Solskjær is the youngest-ever recipient of the knighthood, usually bestowed upon notable members of society in their later years.[252] In 2009, the Norwegian parliament awarded Solskjær its annual Peer Gynt Prize for his work as worthy ambassador of sport and for his ""great social commitment"",[253] in a ceremony at Vinstra Hall.[254] The ex-footballer laughingly admitted in the subsequent press conference that he had neither read nor seen the Ibsen play, yet, but now intends to.[255] Politically, he supports the Norwegian Labour Party and visited their congress in 2011. In a speech delivered there, he publicly pronounced his left-wing political sympathies.[256] Clausenengen Manchester United Individual Manchester United Reserves Molde Manchester United Individual

"74560",":Article","  Antonio Candreva ( Italian pronunciation: [anˈtɔːnjo kanˈdrɛːva]; born 28 February 1987) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a right midfielder or right winger for Serie A club Salernitana. Candreva began his professional club career with Ternana in 2004, where he remained until 2007. He later moved to Udinese, remaining until 2012, but was sent on loan to Livorno, Juventus, Parma, and Cesena during his time with the club. He subsequently transferred to Lazio, where he won the Coppa Italia in his first season with the team. He joined Inter Milan in 2016. At international level he has represented Italy at the 2008 Summer Olympics, at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup (winning a bronze medal in the tournament), at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and at UEFA Euro 2016. Candreva was born on 28 February 1987 in Rome. Candreva is of part Arbëreshe descent as his grandfather, on his father's side, is from the Arbëreshë village of Falconara Albanese in Cosenza.[2][3][4][5][6] Candreva started playing for the youth teams at local club Lodigiani, then transferred to Serie C1 team Ternana in 2003 and played several games for the first team when they were promoted to Serie B for the 2004–05 season. After Ternana were relegated back to Serie C1 the following season, he became a regular in the side and attracted the interest of several Serie A clubs. In June 2007, Candreva was then signed by Serie A club Udinese and played for their Primavera (U-20) team as an overage player.[7] He made his Serie A debut on 27 January 2008 against Inter, and managed several appearances for the first team throughout the season. The 21-year-old was successively loaned out to Serie B outfit Livorno for the 2008–09 season. Together with Alessandro Diamanti, he helped the Tuscan side regain promotion to Serie A as playoff winners. After a successful first season, the loan deal between Udinese and Livorno was subsequently extended to one more year, thus giving Candreva the opportunity to play a full season as a regular in the Italian top flight. On 20 January 2010, it was confirmed Serie A giants Juventus had signed Candreva on loan for the rest of the season, for €500,000,[8] with Juventus having an option to buy half of his contract from Udinese at the end of the season.[9] He scored his first Serie A goal, the winner against Bologna, less than ten minutes after coming on as a substitute for Diego.[10] A few days later, he made his debut in European competitions in the Europa League, in the second leg of the club's round of 32 fixture against Ajax, when he came on as a late substitute for captain Alessandro Del Piero. After the end of the 2009–10 season, Juventus opted not to exercise their right to sign the player permanently and Candreva returned to Udinese in the summer. On 31 August 2010, Candreva signed for Serie A side Parma on a one-year loan deal, for €500,000.[11] Parma had the option to purchase Candreva in a co-ownership deal, but declined to do so. On 21 July 2011, Candreva signed for Serie A side Cesena on an initial one-year loan deal. It cost Cesena €300,000.[12] On the last day of the January 2012 transfer window, he moved to Lazio on a free[13] loan deal,[14] in return Simone Del Nero from Lazio went for a free[13] loan to Cesena.[15] On 7 April 2012, Candreva scored his first goal for Lazio against Napoli in the 2011–12 season, in a 3–1 home victory.[16] On 18 July 2012, the temporary deal was renewed for free with an option to buy.[17][18] With the hiring of Lazio's new coach Vladimir Petković in the 2012–13 season, Candreva finally won over fans and coaching staff, continuously being one of Lazio's best performers. On 2 September 2012, Candreva scored his first goal of the 2012–2013 season in a 3–0 victory against Palermo, following Miroslav Klose's 2 goals. On 26 May 2013, he won the first trophy of his career, the 2012–13 Coppa Italia title, following a 1–0 victory in a historic derby match against cross-city rivals Roma. Candreva assisted Senad Lulić's match-winning goal in the 71st minute of the 2013 Coppa Italia Final.[19] In June 2013, Lazio exercised the option to buy Candreva in a co-ownership deal for €1.7 million on a 4-year contract.[17] In October 2013, Candreva added one more year to his current contract.[20] On 14 June 2014 Lazio bought Candreva outright for another €4 million, so in total Lazio paid Udinese €5.7 million.[21] On 3 August 2016, Candreva joined Inter Milan on a four-year deal for a €22 million fee[22] plus reported bonuses.[23][24][25] On 13 August, Candreva made his unofficial debut for the club in an International Champions Cup preseason match against Celtic; he came on the pitch in the 60th minute, and scored his first goal with the club ten minutes later in a 2–0 win.[26] On 20 October, he scored his first Europa League goal with the club, the only goal of the match, for a 1–0 home win over Southampton.[27] He scored his first league goal with the club on 20 November, in a 2–2 draw with Milan rivals.[28] Candreva made his 100th Serie A appearance for Inter on 29 October 2019 in the 2–1 away win over Brescia in 2019–20 Serie A.[29] On 25 September 2020, Candreva moved to Sampdoria on loan with an obligation to make the deal permanent.[30] On 13 August 2022, Candreva joined Serie A club Salernitana on a one-year loan deal with a conditional obligation to buy.[31][32] Salernitana became the ninth club he has played for in this division. The conditions of the loan deal were fulfilled and the transfer became permanent at the end of the 2022–23 season. Candreva has played for Italy since the U-18 level, making his debut in October 2004. After taking part in his nation's victorious campaign in the 2008 Toulon Tournament, Candreva was named in reserve list for the upcoming Olympics; he was eventually called up as an injury replacement for Tommaso Rocchi.[33] He made his U-21 debut on 9 September 2008 in the 2009 Under-21 European Championship qualifier against Croatia. In May, he was called up to the 23-man squad for 2009 Under-21 European Championships, initially as second choice, and made several substitute appearances as Italy reached the semi-finals of the tournament, in which he started, losing 1–0 to eventual champions Germany.[34] On 14 November 2009, Candreva made his senior national team debut in a friendly match against the Netherlands, which ended in a 0–0 draw.[33] In early May, Candreva was called up for the training camp prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup;[35] he was included by manager Marcello Lippi in the 30-man preliminary squad announced on 11 May 2010,[36] but was dropped from the 28-man provisional team a week later.[37] In October 2012, Antonio Candreva was recalled to the Italy national team by manager Cesare Prandelli to play in a double fixture for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. Candreva earned a spot in the national team following his top performances for Lazio playing in both qualifiers. In June 2013, Candreva was selected by Prandelli to play in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.[33] In the knockout stages of the tournament knockout stage, during the semi-final against Spain national football team the match had to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Candreva stepped up to take the first penalty and scored past Iker Casillas by chipping the ball, in a way that recalled the famous penalty scored by Czech legend Antonín Panenka in the UEFA Euro 1976 Final.[38] Italy finished third after defeating Uruguay on penalties in the bronze medal match.[39] On 1 June 2014, Candreva was selected in Italy's 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[40] In Italy's opening match of the tournament in Manaus on 14 June, he assisted Mario Balotelli's match-winning goal in a 2–1 defeat of England. He was also involved in Claudio Marchisio's opening goal, as he played a short corner to Marco Verratti, who then passed the ball out wide towards Andrea Pirlo, who drew his marker with him; Pirlo let the ball pass in between his legs to Marchisio, leaving him with space to score with a low drive from outside the area.[41][42] Italy lost their next two matches, however, and finished in third place in their group, and were eliminated in the first round for a second consecutive World Cup.[43] On 16 November 2014, Candreva scored his first international goal in a 1–1 Euro 2016 qualifier draw against Croatia.[44] On 12 June 2015, he scored Italy's equalising goal,[45] from a Panenka style penalty, in the 36th minute of a 1–1 Euro 2016 qualifier away draw against Croatia in an empty Split stadium.[46] On 10 October 2015, he assisted Stephan El Shaarawy's match-winning goal in Italy's 3–1 away win over Azerbaijan in a European qualifying match; the win guaranteed Italy a place at Euro 2016.[47] On 31 May 2016, he was named to Antonio Conte's 23-man Italy squad for Euro 2016.[48] On 13 June he made his tournament debut and set up Graziano Pellè's goal in stoppage time in a 2–0 win over Belgium in the opening group match of Euro 2016.[49] After being ruled out of Italy's final group match, a 1–0 defeat to Ireland, due to an injury sustained in Italy's 1–0 victory over Sweden,[50] on 25 June, it was confirmed that Candreva would also miss out on the round of 16 match up with Spain on 27 June due to a thigh problem[51] – and subsequently the 6–5 penalty shoot-out loss to Germany in the quarter final on 2 July.[52] Naturally right-footed, Candreva can be deployed in several midfield positions due to his versatility, although he usually plays either in a central role as an attacking midfielder or more frequently as a traditional winger on the right side of the pitch; a former forward, he is also capable of playing on the left, and has also been used as a wing-back or full-back, as a second striker, as a central or box-to-box midfielder, as a mezzala, or even in a deeper role in front of the back-line, due to his defensive work-rate and tactical awareness. He has also been deployed as a false attacking midfielder on occasion.[53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62] A dynamic, tenacious, physical, and well-rounded player, he is well known for his pace, stamina, consistency and work-rate, which enable him to cover the flank effectively, as well as his eye for goal;[53][54][56][59][60][63][64][65][66][67] he is known for his ability to get forward, and possesses a powerful, accurate long-range shot with both feet,[67][68][69] as well as being an accurate free kick[53][60][70] and penalty kick taker.[53][65][71] He is also gifted with vision and creativity,[67] as well as precise passing, good distribution, and his excellent crossing ability and set-piece delivery, which enable him to create chances and provide several assists for teammates.[53][54][56][59][60][68][72] In addition to these attributes, he also has good technical ability, ball control and dribbling skills, which enable him to get past opposing defenders and both exploit and create space for his team.[53][54][55][56][63][66][67][68][73] Lazio Italy U21 Individual","Antonio Candreva","[""Antonio Candreva"",""Serie

"74561",":Article","  Mick Bates (19 September 1947 – 12 July 2021) was an English footballer who played as a midfielder in the Football League for Leeds United, Walsall, Bradford City and Doncaster Rovers.[1] He was best known for playing for Leeds during the Don Revie period. Bates was born in Armthorpe, Doncaster,[1] and began his football career as an apprentice with Leeds United. Although primarily a squad player at Elland Road, not being able to break into the regular eleven due to Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles not releasing their places in the sides, Bates was still an excellent part of Don Revie's Leeds squad of the 1960s and early 1970s. Signing professional forms in 1964, Bates made 187 appearances for Leeds scoring nine goals, including one against Juventus in the 2–2 first leg of the Fairs Cup Final of 1971 away in Turin. This goal along with a 1–1 score-line at Elland Road helped Leeds to triumph in the competition with Leeds winning on the away goals rule.[2] Leeds won the league twice during his time at the club in 1969 and 1974. Bates contributed only four appearances to the first of these titles but ten, enough for a medal, to the second.[3] He remained loyal to Leeds for 12 years despite the fact he would have probably retained a regular place in most other sides. A repetition of knee injuries between 1974 and 1976 kept him out of the action for much of that time. He eventually left Leeds in the summer of 1976,[4] going to Walsall for £25,000. Bates later had spells at Bradford City, from 1978 to 1980 joining for £20,000 and Doncaster Rovers, joining for free. He retired from professional football in 1981 and ran his own insurance firm.[5] He died on 12 July 2021, aged 73.[6]","Mick Bates","[""Mick Bates"",""midfielder"",""Leeds United"",""Doncaster Rovers."",""Football League"",""Walsall"",""Bradford City"",""English"",""Don Revie"",""goal"",""squad player"",""football career"",""apprentice"",""Elland Road"",""goals"",""goals"",""sides"",""squad"",""part"",""places"",""league"",""first"",""appearances"",""leg"",""score-line"",""appearances"",""eleven"",""forms"",""competition"",""club"",""Armthorpe"",""much"",""action"",""spells"",""one"",""football"",""Juventus"",""Turin"",""Fairs Cup Final"",""Johnny Giles"",""Billy Bremner"",""insurance"",""place"",""sides"",""Doncaster Rovers"",""titles"",""medal"",""fact"",""knee injuries"",""repetition"",""second."",""12 July 2021"",""2"",""1964"",""1971"",""1969"",""1974"",""1974"",""1976"",""1976"",""1978"",""1980"",""1981"",""12 July 2021"",""£25,000"",""£20,000"",""12"",""1976"",""73"",""1"",""1969"",""1974"",""20,000"",""1978"",""12"",""1960"",""1947"",""4"",""one"",""2021"",""1"",""12"",""1974"",""1976"",""3"",""5"",""four"",""19"",""187"",""2021"",""ten"",""2"",""eleven"",""6"",""25,000"",""1980"",""1"",""2"",""nine"",""1970"",""1"",""1971"",""1964"",""1981"",""19 September 1947""]","0.0032058486902992777","true","[0.73666954,0.020499073,0.018097512,0.018097512,0.013875365,0.013039705,0.013039705,0.012204957,0.008509279,0.0053914264,0.0042441958,0.003772771,0.003772771,0.0036494534,0.0031897852,0.0029189761,0.0028844387,0.0028844387,0.0027616103,0.0027125834,0.0026626925,0.002656734,0.002656734,0.0025562842,0.0025492841,0.0025419404,0.0025340056,0.002525063,0.0023391403,0.0023391403,0.0022318324,0.0017557057,0.0017557057,0.0017502878,0.0017037961,0.0016402062,0.001511497,0.001511497,0.001511497,0.0014983111,0.0014983111,0.001223545,0.0010433516,8.782183E-4,8.2435634E-4,7.7134604E-4,7.7134604E-4,7.7134604E-4,7.698838E-4,6.9768145E-4,4.5577416E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","Mick Bates (English footballer) - Wikipedia","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Bates_(English_footballer)",,,,,,,

"76471",":Query","  Thierry Daniel Henry ( French pronunciation: [tjɛʁi danjɛl ɑ̃ʁi]; born 17 August 1977) is a French professional football coach, pundit, sports broadcaster and former player. He is currently the manager of the France national under-21 team. He is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time,[4][5][6][7][8] and one of the greatest players in Premier League history. He has been named by Arsenal as the club's greatest ever player.[9] Henry was runner-up for both the Ballon d'Or in 2003 and the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2003 and 2004. He was named the FWA Footballer of the Year a record three times, the PFA Players' Player of the Year a joint-record two times, and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six consecutive times. He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI once and the UEFA Team of the Year five times. In 2004, Henry was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[10] Henry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994 before signing for defending Serie A champions Juventus. However, limited playing time, coupled with disagreements with the club's hierarchy, led to him signing for Premier League club Arsenal for £11 million in 1999. Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger, Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions. He won the Premier League Golden Boot a record four times, won two FA Cups and two Premier League titles with the club, including one during an unbeaten Invincible season. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain, leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. Henry transferred to Barcelona in 2007 and in the 2008–09 season, he was a key part of the club's historic treble when they won La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League. In 2010, he joined Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls and returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012, before retiring in 2014. Henry had success with France, winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000, and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. He was named French Player of the Year a record five times, named to the UEFA Euro 2000 Team of the Tournament, awarded both the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and named to the 2006 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. In October 2007, he became his country's record goalscorer, a record he held until December 2022.[11] After amassing 123 appearances and 51 goals, Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup. After retiring, Henry transitioned into coaching. He began coaching Arsenal's youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work as a pundit for Sky Sports. In 2016, he was appointed as an assistant coach at Belgium, before assuming the role as the head coach at Monaco in 2018. He was relieved of his duties at Monaco in January 2019 and returned to MLS less than a year later to manage Montréal Impact. He led Montréal to the playoffs in the 2020 season before departing in 2021, returning to his role as an assistant coach for Belgium for a year and a half. Henry is of Antillean heritage:[12] his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He was born and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities.[13][14] As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football.[2] He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years.[12] US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.[13] In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry, then at the age of 13 in a match.[15] Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite INF Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger's Monaco as a youth player.[2] Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice.[15] Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.[12] After a tentative start to his Monaco career, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the 1996–97 season, his solid performances helped the club win the Ligue 1 title.[2][16] During the 1997–98 season, he was instrumental in leading his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-final, setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition.[12][17] By his third season, he had received his first cap for the national team, and was part of the winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[12] He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the club, the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances.[16] Henry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his intimate and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian club Juventus for £10.5 million.[2] He played on the wing,[18] as well as at wing back and wide midfield, but he was ineffective as a goal scorer, struggling against the defensive discipline exhibited by teams in Serie A, registering just three goals in 16 appearances.[19] In 2019, on Jamie Carragher's podcast The Greatest Game, Henry attributed disagreements with Juve director Luciano Moggi as his rationale behind departing the club.[20] Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of £11 million, reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger.[21][22] It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer,[23] and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee.[12] Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka, Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games.[13] After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to ""be re-taught everything about the art of striking.""[13] These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26.[24] Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United, and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Galatasaray.[12] Coming off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000–01 season. Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goalscorer. His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up (with his back turned to goal), before he swivelled and volleyed in from 20 yards out.[25] The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser ""Whassup?"" advertisement.[26] Armed with one of the league's best attacks, Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League. The team also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool. Henry remained frustrated, however, by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.[12] Success finally arrived during the 2001–02 season. Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title, and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final.[12] Henry became the league's top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club.[2][27] There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.[12] 2002–03 proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists—remarkable returns for a striker.[27] In doing so, he led Arsenal to another FA Cup triumph (where he was man-of-the-match in the Final),[28] although Arsenal failed to retain their Premier League title.[29] Throughout the season, he competed with Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy for the league scoring title, but the Dutchman edged Henry to the Golden Boot by a single goal.[12] Nonetheless, Henry was named both the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year.[30][31] His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[23] With 24 goals and 20 assists in the league, Henry set a new record for most assists in a single Premier League season,[32] and also became the first player in history to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single season in one of Europe's top–five leagues—this feat has since been matched by Lionel Messi in 2020.[33][34] Entering the 2003–04 season, Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pires, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process.[35] Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year,[30][31] Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award.[23] With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot.[2][36] However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.[12] This dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season, although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury).[16] Henry maintained his reputation as one of Europe's most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring,[2] and with 31 goals in all competitions,[37] he was the co-recipient (with Diego Forlán) of the European Golden Boot, becoming the first player to officially win the award twice in a row (Ally McCoist had won two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed unofficial).[36] The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game.[2] Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.[38] The 2005–06 season proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club's top goalscorer of all time;[39] two goals against Sparta Prague in the Champions League meant he broke Ian Wright's record of 185 goals.[40] On 1 February 2006, he scored a goal against West Ham United, bringing his league goal tally up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin's league goals record.[41] Henry scored his 100th league goal at Highbury, a feat unparalleled in the history of the club, and a unique achievement in the Premier League.[42] On the final day of the Premier League season, Henry scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic in the last match played at Highbury. He completed the season as the league's top goalscorer,[2] was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.[16][43] Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final. The Gunners eventually lost 2–1 to Barcelona, with Henry assisting the team's only goal from a free kick, and Arsenal's inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract, and said he would stay at Arsenal for life.[31][44] Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein later claimed the club had turned down two bids of £50 million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract.[45] Had the transfer materialised, it would have surpassed the then-world record £47 million paid for Zinedine Zidane.[45] Henry's 2006–07 season was marred by injuries.[46] Although he scored 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match,[47] but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing the rest of the 2006–07 season.[48] Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.[46] On 25 June 2007, in an unexpected turn of events, Henry was transferred to Barcelona for €24 million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season.[49] It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million.[50] Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving,[51] and maintained that ""I always said that if I ever left Arsenal it would be to play for Barcelona.""[52] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry said that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, ""Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on.""[53] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals;[2] in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.[54] At Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 jersey, the same as he had worn at Arsenal. He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Lyon,[55] and he recorded his first hat-trick for Barça in a Primera División match against Levante ten days later.[56] But with Henry mostly deployed on the wing throughout the season, he was unable to reproduce the goal-scoring form he achieved with Arsenal. He expressed dissatisfaction with the move to Barcelona in the initial year, amidst widespread speculation of a return to the Premier League. In an interview with Garth Crooks on BBC's Football Focus, Henry described missing life ""back home"" and even ""the English press.""[57] However, Henry concluded his debut season as the club's top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists, second behind Lionel Messi's ten.[58] Henry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated 2008–09 campaign, with 26 goals and 10 assists from the left wing.[59] He won the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final. Barcelona won the Primera División and UEFA Champions League soon after, completing a treble for the Frenchman, who had combined with Messi and Samuel Eto'o to score 100 goals between them that season.[60] The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid's Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano and Luis del Sol of the 1960–61 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuaín who scored 89 goals in 2011–12).[61] Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple, consisting of the aforementioned treble, the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.[62] The following season, the emergence of Pedro meant that Henry only started 15 league games.[27] Before the La Liga season ended, and with a year still left on his contract, club president Joan Laporta stated on 5 May 2010 that Henry ""may go away in the summer transfer window if that's what he wants.""[63] After Henry returned from the 2010 World Cup, Barcelona confirmed that they had agreed to the sale of Henry to an unnamed club, with the player still to agree terms with the new club.[64] In July 2010, Henry signed a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player.[65] He made his full MLS debut on 31 July in a 2–2 draw against Houston Dynamo, assisting both goals to Juan Pablo Ángel. His first MLS goal came on 28 August in a 2–0 victory against San Jose Earthquakes. The Red Bulls eventually topped the MLS Eastern Conference by one point over Columbus Crew[66] before losing 3–2 on aggregate against San Jose Earthquakes in the quarter-finals of the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs.[67] The next season, the Red Bulls were 10th overall in the league,[68] and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs.[69] After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012. This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh, who were unavailable due to their participation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.[70] Henry was given the number 12 jersey – his old Arsenal number 14 jersey, the same number he wore at Barcelona and New York, was unavailable, with Theo Walcott inheriting it following Henry's departure from the club in 2007.[71] Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against Leeds United in the FA Cup third round and scored the only goal.[72] In his last league game on loan, he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 2–1 win against Sunderland.[73] His final goals for the club meant he finished his Arsenal career with a record 228 goals; 175 of them came in the Premier League. On 17 February 2012, Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the 2012 season. His base salary of $5 million ($5.6 million guaranteed) made him the highest-paid player in MLS—surpassing David Beckham, who had taken a salary cut for his last year with the Los Angeles Galaxy.[74] In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75 million setting him behind Robbie Keane's $4 million base salary. With bonuses, however, Henry remained the highest-paid player with $4.35 million compared to Keane's $4.33 million.[75] On 31 March 2012, Henry scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 5–2 Red Bulls win over the Montreal Impact.[76] He was named MLS Player of the Month that same month. On 27 October 2013, Henry scored once and provided two assists in the last game of the season against the Chicago Fire at Red Bull Arena to help his team win 5–2 and become champions of the regular season. It was the club's first major trophy in their 17-year history.[77][78] On 12 July 2014, Henry provided a goal and three assists in a 4–1 Red Bulls win over the Columbus Crew. With that effort he became the all-time assist leader for the New York Red Bulls with 37, surpassing Amado Guevara and Tab Ramos.[79] On 1 December 2014, it was announced that Henry had left the Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years at the club.[80] On 16 December, he announced his retirement as a player and stated that he would begin working for Sky Sports as a pundit.[81] After working at Sky for over three years, Henry quit his position in July 2018 to focus on his career as a coach.[82] Henry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team, winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team, where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet.[2] Within four months, France head coach Aimé Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team. The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2–1 win against South Africa.[83] Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level, he ended the tournament as France's top scorer with three goals.[84] He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final, where France beat Brazil 3–0, but Marcel Desailly's sending off forced a defensive change instead. In 1998, he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, France's highest decoration.[85] Henry was a member of France's UEFA Euro 2000 squad, again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equaliser against Portugal in the semi-final, and finishing as the country's top scorer.[86][87] France later won the game in extra time following a converted penalty kick by Zinedine Zidane. France went on to defeat Italy in extra-time in the final, earning Henry his second major international medal.[88] During the tournament, Henry was voted man of the match in three games, including the final against Italy.[89][90] The 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games.[2] France lost against Senegal in their first group match and Henry was red carded for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against Uruguay.[12] In that game, France played to a 0–0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final group match due to suspension; France lost 2–0 to Denmark.[12] Henry returned to form for his country at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and Patrick Vieira, France won, in large part owing to Henry's outstanding play, for which he was named Man of the Match by FIFA's Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches.[2] In the final, he scored the golden goal in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1–0 victory over Cameroon.[2] Henry was awarded both the Adidas Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the Adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament's top goalscorer with four goals.[2] In UEFA Euro 2004, Henry played in all of France's matches and scored two goals.[16] France beat England in the group stage but lost to the eventual winners Greece 1–0 in the quarter-finals.[92] During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad. He played as a lone striker, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including the winning goal from Zidane's free kick against defending champions Brazil in the quarter-final.[2] However, France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties (5–3) in the final. Henry did not take part in the penalty shoot-out, having been substituted in extra time after his legs had cramped.[93] Henry was one of ten nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane[94] and was named a starting striker on the 2006 FIFPro World XI team.[95] On 13 October 2007, Henry scored his 41st goal against the Faroe Islands, joining Michel Platini as the country's top goalscorer of all time.[53] Four days later at the Stade de la Beaujoire, he scored a late double against Lithuania, thereby setting a new record as France's top goalscorer.[96] On 3 June 2008, Henry made his 100th appearance for the national team in a match against Colombia, becoming the sixth French player ever to reach that milestone.[97] Henry missed the opening game of France's short-lived UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in the same group as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania.[98] He scored France's only goal in the competition in a 4–1 loss to the Netherlands.[99] The French team struggled during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and finished second in their group behind Serbia. During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry was involved in a controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner.[100] This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman, while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him.[101][102] The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined.[103] Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a ""cheat""; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that ""the fairest solution would be to replay the game"".[104] FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as ""blatant unfair play"" and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee.[105] Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened in the aftermath of the incident.[106] In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.[107] Henry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. France drew in their first game against Uruguay, and lost 2–0 in their second against Mexico. The team was thrown into disarray when Nicolas Anelka was expelled from the team, and captain Patrice Evra led a team protest by refusing to train.[108] In the final group game against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute, France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament. He then announced his retirement from international football, having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for Les Bleus, thus finishing his international career as France's all-time top scorer, and second most capped player after Lilian Thuram.[109] Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth,[13] he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp.[18] During the 2004–05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to 4–5–1.[110] This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker.[18] Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman: ""Thierry Henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score"".[111] One of the reasons cited for Henry's impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones.[112] According to his father Antoine, Henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten.[13] He was also influenced by Romário, Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal.[113] At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score.[13][114] In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: ""I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best.""[13] When up front, Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position,[115][116] something which enables him to contribute heavily in assists: between 2002–03 and 2004–05, the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity.[39] Ranking Henry the greatest player in Premier League history, in February 2020 FourFourTwo magazine stated, ""No one assisted more in a season. No one has terrorised defenders with such a combination of bewitching grace and phenomenal power.""[117] Coming in from the left, Henry's trademark finish saw him place the ball inside the far right corner of the goal.[118] Henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside trap, although he never provided Arsenal a distinct aerial threat.[119] Given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker, the Frenchman is not a prototypical ""out-and-out striker"", but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe's most prolific strikers.[12] In set pieces, Henry was the first-choice penalty and free kick taker for Arsenal, scoring regularly from those situations.[120][121] Henry was also a notable exponent of a no-look pass where he would feint to pass the ball with his right foot, but would make contact with the ball using his standing foot (his left).[122] Henry began coaching Arsenal's youth teams in February 2015, in tandem with his work for Sky Sports.[123] His influence on the team was praised by players such as Alex Iwobi, who dedicated a goal against Bayern Munich in the 2015–16 UEFA Youth League to his advice.[124] Having earned a UEFA A Licence, he was offered the job of under-18 coach by Academy head Andries Jonker, but the decision was overruled by Wenger, who wanted a full-time coach for the team.[125] In August 2016, Henry became second assistant coach of the Belgium national team, working alongside head coach Roberto Martínez and fellow assistant Graeme Jones.[126] In an interview with NBC Sports, Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku praised Henry for his work with him, stating, ""Henry is the best thing that has happened to me because since I came to England aged 18 I have had the best mentors. Thierry for me is the best. Every day whether it is positive and negative I take it in my stride because I know what is expected from the top level.""[127] At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Belgium reached the semi-final, but lost to Henry's home nation France 1–0.[128] Henry picked up a Bronze medal after Belgium defeated England 2–0 in the third-place play-off to secure their best ever World Cup finish.[129] Henry was reportedly offered the position of head coach by Bordeaux in August 2018.[130][131] However, the offer was not accepted by Henry after disagreements with the club's owners.[132][133] Days after turning down the Bordeaux job, and following Jones's departure from the Belgium national team, Henry, who had been the forwards coach, was promoted to Belgium assistant coach.[134] However, his tenure in the role was short-lived, after he accepted the role as head coach at former club Monaco in October.[135] On 11 October 2018, Monaco dismissed Leonardo Jardim as club manager.[136] Jardim's position had become untenable after struggling heavily in domestic competition, with the club 18th at the time of his departure, and disputes over the club's transfer policy.[137] Monaco's search for a new coach coincided with the regulatory mid-season international break, allowing the club sufficient time to search for a replacement, however, they quickly decided on Henry, and he was appointed a mere two days later.[135] He signed a three-year deal, and was unveiled as Monaco manager on 18 October. At his first press conference, he told reporters: ""This club will always have a big place in my heart, so to be able to come here and start again, it is a dream come true. There is a lot of work to do, as you can imagine – but I am more than happy to be here"".[138] Henry's arrival at Monaco was greeted with mixed reactions by some media outlets, due to his relative inexperience as a top-level coach and the task of overturning Monaco's misfortunes. Despite inheriting a squad of sub-standard quality,[139] Henry expressed a desire of replicating the football he played under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, as well as instilling the ""professionalism"" taught to him by Arsène Wenger.[140] Henry also adopted a hands-on approach to training sessions, being regularly involved in devising schemes and instructing drills.[141] His first match was a 2–1 away defeat against Strasbourg on 20 October.[142] He was unable to secure a win for over a month, enduring a period which included two high-profile defeats against Club Brugge[143] and Paris Saint-Germain,[144] prior to defeating Caen on 1–0 on 25 November.[145] He secured two wins in December, defeating Amiens in the league and Lorient in the Coupe de la Ligue, however, this was on the backdrop of three additional Ligue 1 defeats to close 2018 in the relegation zone.[146][147] In January 2019, Henry entered the winter transfer window, where he signed left-back Fodé Ballo-Touré, and former Arsenal teammate Cesc Fàbregas from Chelsea. He also sanctioned the loan signing of French defensive midfielder William Vainqueur on 12 January, and experienced defender Naldo. However, these signings would not turn around the club's fate, and on 24 January, Henry was dismissed at Monaco. The club were 19th at the time of his departure, and Henry left with a record of 4 wins, 5 draws, and 11 defeats, from 20 games in charge.[148] On 14 November 2019, Henry became manager of Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact, signing a two-year deal until the end of the 2021 season with an option to extend it by a year until the 2022 season.[149] In his first press conference, Henry stated he had to ""confront"" the relative disappointment of his short stint as manager of Monaco, before undertaking a new job.[150] After leading Montreal to their first playoff berth in four seasons, on 25 February 2021, prior to the 2021 season, Henry stepped down as head coach of the renamed CF Montreal to be closer to his children in London. He had not been able to see them in the 2020 season due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, and with restrictions continuing into the 2021 season, he decided to end the separation.[151][152] In May 2021, Henry rejoined the coaching staff of Belgium prior to the UEFA Euro 2020.[153][154] He was also in the team's coaching staff for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In February 2023, upon the appointment of Domenico Tedesco as Belgium's new head coach, Royal Belgian Football Association CEO Peter Bossaert announced that Henry would not be returning to the national team's coaching staff.[155] Henry was considered as being one of potential replacements for Corinne Diacre who got fired as France women's national football team head coach, but he turned down the possibility of managing them in favor of waiting for the United States men's national soccer team to offer him the position of permanent head coach.[156] On 21 August 2023, Henry was named as the new manager of the France national under-21 team and the France Olympic team who will lead the French during the 2024 Summer Olympics.[157] After leaving CF Montreal, Henry resumed his punditry career. He joined CBS Sports in their UEFA Champions League coverage as studio analyst on 27 September 2021,[158] as well as being hired by Amazon Prime Video for their Premier League and Ligue 1 programs as consultant.[159] Remember the kid in the playground who was better than everyone else with a football at his feet? That's what Thierry Henry was like in his pomp. The Frenchman had exquisite technique, searing pace, and like the typical schoolboy superstar, he did pretty much everything for his team. —Arsenal.com entry for Henry ranking him #1 in their list of the 50 Greatest Arsenal Players.[160] Henry has received many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards;[23] in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players' Player of the Year titles.[30] Henry is the only player ever to have won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times (2003, 2004, 2006),[31] and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions. Henry was voted into the Premier League Overseas Team of the Decade in the 10 Seasons Awards poll in 2003,[161] and in 2004 he was named by football legend Pelé on the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[162] In terms of goal-scoring awards, Henry was the European Golden Boot winner in 2004 and 2005 (sharing it with Villarreal's Diego Forlán in 2005).[36] Henry was also the top goalscorer in the Premier League for a record four seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006).[2] In 2006, he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons (2002 to 2006).[164] With 175, Henry is currently seventh in the list of all-time Premier League goalscorers, behind Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane, Andy Cole, Sergio Agüero, and Frank Lampard. He held the record for most goals in the competition for one club, until it was broken by Rooney in 2016,[165] and held the record for most goals by a foreign player in the competition until surpassed by Agüero in 2020.[166] France's all-time record goalscorer was, in his prime in the mid 2000s, regarded by many coaches, footballers and journalists as one of the best players in the world.[27][167][168][169] In November 2007, he was ranked 33rd on the Association of Football Statisticians' compendium for ""Greatest Ever Footballers"".[170] Arsenal fans honoured their former player in 2008, declaring Henry the greatest Arsenal player.[54] In two other 2008 surveys, Henry emerged as the favourite Premier League player of all time among 32,000 people surveyed in the Barclays 2008 Global Fan Report.[171][172] Arsenal fan and The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey mentions Henry in the tribute song ""Highbury Highs"", which he performed at Arsenal's last game at Highbury on 7 May 2006.[173] On 10 December 2011, Arsenal unveiled a bronze statue of Henry at the Emirates Stadium as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations.[174] In 2017, FourFourTwo magazine ranked him first in their list of the 30 best strikers in Premier League history.[175] Daniel Girard of The Toronto Star described Henry as ""one of the best players of his generation"" in 2010.[176] Henry's former Arsenal manager, Wenger, described him as ""one of the greatest players [he had] ever seen"" in 2014.[177] In 2019, The Independent ranked Henry in first place in their list of the ""100 greatest Premier League players"".[178] Henry married English model Nicole Merry, real name Claire, on 5 July 2003.[13] The ceremony was held at Highclere Castle, and on 27 May 2005 the couple celebrated the birth of their first child.[179] Henry dedicated his first goal following Téa's birth to her by holding his fingers in a ""T"" shape and kissing them after scoring in a match against Newcastle United.[180] When Henry was still at Arsenal, he also purchased a home in Hampstead, North London.[13] However, shortly after his transfer to Barcelona, it was announced that Henry and his wife would divorce; the decree nisi was granted in September 2007,[181] ""on the basis of his behavior.""[182] Their separation concluded in December 2008 when Henry paid Merry a divorce settlement close to her requested sum of £10 million.[183] Henry has been with his second wife, Andrea Rajačić, since 2011.[184] They have three children together.[184] In January 2024, Henry said he had been depressed throughout his career,[185] and that his father had been a demanding presence when he was young.[186] As a fan of the National Basketball Association (NBA), Henry is often seen with his friend Tony Parker at games when not playing football. Henry stated in an interview that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement.[187] Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past, he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals;[188] and in the 2001 NBA Finals, he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson, whom he named as one of his favourite players.[187] Henry makes a short cameo appearance in the 2015 film Entourage. Henry's part sees him walking a dog and having exchange with Ari Gold (character played by Jeremy Piven), who is an over-the-top Hollywood agent.[189] He makes a number of cameo appearances playing himself in the Apple TV+ football comedy series Ted Lasso.[190] Henry makes a number of appearances in the Amazon Original sports docuseries All or Nothing: Arsenal, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season.[191] Henry is a member of the UNICEF-FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups. In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.[84] Having been subjected to racism in the past, Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football. The most prominent incident of racism against Henry was during a training session with the Spanish national team in 2004,[192][193] when a Spanish TV crew caught coach Luis Aragonés referring to Henry as ""black shit"" to José Antonio Reyes, Henry's teammate at Arsenal.[180] The incident caused an uproar in the British media, and there were calls for Aragonés to be sacked.[194] Henry and Nike started the Stand Up Speak Up campaign against racism in football as a result of the incident.[195] Subsequently, in 2007, Time featured him as one of the ""Heroes & Pioneers"" on the Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.[196] Along with 45 other football players, Henry took part in FIFA's ""Live for Love United"" in 2002.

In a 3–2 win for France, Henry played a trademark no-look one-two pass with Zinedine Zidane before scoring with a 20-yard curling strike.[122] In 2006, Henry was valued as the ninth-most commercially marketable footballer in the world, and throughout his career he has signed many endorsements and appeared in commercials.[199] At the beginning of his career, Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike. In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Henry featured in Nike's ""Secret Tournament"" advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, along with 24 superstar football players.[200][201] In a 2004 advertisement, Henry pits his wits against others footballers in locations such as his bedroom and living room, which was partly inspired by Henry himself, who revealed that he always has a football nearby, even at home.[202] In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Henry also featured in Nike's Joga Bonito campaign, Portuguese for ""beautiful game"".[203] Henry's deal with Nike ended after the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when he signed a deal with Reebok to appear in their ""I Am What I Am"" campaign.[204] As part of Reebok Entertainment's ""Framed"" series, Henry was the star of a half-hour episode that detailed the making of a commercial about himself directed by Spanish actress Paz Vega.[205] In 2011, Henry switched to Puma boots.[206] Henry featured in the Renault Clio advertisements in which he popularised the term va-va-voom, meaning ""life"" or ""passion"".

their Champions poster, but subsequently released a statement backing Henry.[209][210] Henry was part of Pepsi's ""Dare For More"" campaign in 2005, alongside the likes of David Beckham and Ronaldinho.[211] He starred in a 2014 advert for Beats headphones with other global football stars including Neymar and Luis Suárez, with the theme of ""The Game Before the Game"" and the players pre-game ritual of listening to music.[212] Henry featured on the front cover of the editions of EA Sports' FIFA video game series from FIFA 2001 to FIFA 2005.[213][214] He was included as an icon to
