"743",":Query","2023/10/04 TOPPAN、アルミ箔を使用しない環境配慮型の蓋材を開発 アルミ箔を使用しないカップ入り即席麺用の蓋材で、CO₂排出量削減に貢献    共有する  PDF 　TOPPANホールディングスのグループ会社であるTOPPAN株式会社（本社:東京都文京区、代表取締役社長:齊藤 昌典、以下 TOPPAN）は、即席麺蓋材の環境対応化策として「アルミレス蓋材」を開発しました。従来、カップ入り即席麺に使用されている蓋材には、注湯時に蓋を広げたり閉じたりする際に折り曲げた状態で維持できる「デッドホールド性」が必要なため、アルミ箔を使用した材質構成が採用されていました。今回開発した「アルミレス蓋材」は、「デッドホールド性」を保持する用紙を開発し、アルミ箔を使用した材質構成と同等のリクローズ性能を有しています。また、製造時のCO₂排出量を従来のアルミ箔を使用した材質構成と比較して約32%削減※1が可能です。 　なお本製品は、2023年10月4日（水）から6日（金）に開催される「第3回サステナブル　マテリアル展（SUSMA）」（会場：幕張メッセ）のTOPPANブース（4ホール 小間番号26-50）に展示します。 「アルミレス蓋材」のイメージ © TOPPAN INC. 「アルミレス蓋材」のイメージ © TOPPAN INC. 開発の背景 　昨今の世界経済情勢の影響を受け、電力・ガスをはじめとするエネルギーコストが高騰し、アルミ箔の価格も連動して高騰しています。また、CO₂排出量削減という社会課題に対して、アルミ箔は製造工程で多くのCO₂を排出しているため、食品や日用品のパッケージにおけるアルミレス化は社会課題となっています。従来のカップ入り即席麺の蓋材は、注湯の際にふたが開いた状態を維持することと、注湯後に蓋を閉じることができるリクローズ性が必要なため、アルミ箔を使用した材質構成が採用されていました。このたび、デッドホールド性を保持する用紙を開発し、アルミ箔を使用した材質構成と同等のリクローズ性能を有するアルミレス蓋材を開発しました。 「本製品」の特長 ・デッドホールド性能 　カップ入り即席麺に使用されている蓋材には、注湯の際にふたが開いた状態を維持することと、注湯後に蓋を閉じることができるリクローズ時のデッドホールド性が必要なため、その機能を担保できるアルミ箔を使用した材質構成が採用されていました。今回、用紙メーカーとの共同開発により、デッドホールド性を持つ用紙を開発。現行アルミ蓋同様の取り扱いで調理をすることが可能です。また、印刷表面のニス種の選定により、デッドホールド性の向上を図っています。 ・CO₂排出量削減 　製造時のCO₂排出量について、従来のアルミ箔を使用した材質構成と比較し、32%の削減が可能です。 ・アルミ箔を使用した材質構成と同等の内容物保護性能 　アルミ箔を使用した材質構成と同等の耐油性と遮光性を付与しているので、内容物の変更を行わずにアルミ箔を使用した蓋材からの切り替えが可能です。 価格 　従来のアルミ箔を使用した材質構成の蓋材と同等の価格を実現しました。 今後の目標 　TOPPANは「アルミレス蓋材」を食品メーカー向けに提供し2025年度に10億円の売り上げを目指します。今後もTOPPANは、持続可能な社会の実現に向けて、パッケージを起点としたTOPPANグループのサステナブルブランド「SMARTS」を掲げ、社会課題に対応したパッケージの開発を推進します。 TOPPANグループのサステナブルブランド「SMARTS™」について SMARTS ・サステナブルな未来に、スマートな選択を 　「SMARTS™」は、パッケージを起点としたTOPPANグループのサステナブルブランドです。パッケージで培った技術・ノウハウに、マーケティング・DX・BPOなどのリソースを掛け合わせ、バリューチェーンに沿った最適な選択肢を提供します。TOPPANは、「SMARTS™」が持つ多彩なソリューションで、ステークホルダーの皆さまとともに持続可能な社会の実現に貢献します。 SMARTS™

　本VR作品中には、「冬木小袖」の修理の様子を取材した映像や、「冬木小袖」も含めた東京国立博物館所蔵の小袖の名品7件を江戸時代当時の人物が着用した様子の再現CG等が登場。それらを通して、現代のきものの原型である小袖への理解を深め、その魅力を伝えます。 　2023年10月3日（火）～12月3日（日）の期間には、同館の総合文化展（本館10室）で、「冬木小袖」が修理後初めて展示されます。同期間中は、展示室とシアターを併せて鑑賞することで、尾形光琳直筆のきものとして非常に貴重な「冬木小袖」の魅力を、リアルとデジタルのどちらも楽しむことができます。 　また、2023年11月1日（水）から、本VR作品をシアター公式のニコニコチャンネルで配信し、場所や時間を問わずに「冬木小袖」の魅力に触れる機会を提供します。さらに、2023年11月8日（水）から11月19日（日）の期間、きものを着て来場するとシアター鑑賞料が無料になる、「きもの着用でVR鑑賞料無料キャンペーン」を実施します。 「冬木小袖」について 重要文化財　小袖 白綾地秋草模様

　正式名称は重要文化財「小袖　白綾地秋草模様」（江戸時代・18世紀）。江戸時代に活躍し琳派の語源としても知られる絵師・尾形光琳（1658-1716）が、寄宿した江戸・深川の材木商、冬木屋の夫人のために描いたといわれるため、〈冬木小袖〉という名称で親しまれています。 　白い絹地に、藍や墨などで菊、萩、桔梗、芒（すすき）といった秋草が描かれています。 　経年などによる劣化に加え、旧修理によって絵柄の鑑賞が損なわれる状態にあったため、2020年に東京国立博物館と文化財活用センターが共同で修理プロジェクトを立ち上げ、集められた寄附により、本格修理が実現しました。 VR作品『冬木小袖　光琳が描いたきもの』について VR作品『冬木小袖　光琳が描いたきもの』 監修：東京国立博物館、文化財活用センター 制作：TOPPAN株式会社

"747",":Article","2023年10月23日 DNPとトーハン　トーハン桶川センター内の書籍製造ライン導入を目指す DNP久喜工場の製造ラインを一部移管し、読者の需要に応じた商品供給を強化 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 出版・電子出版・教育 印刷・加工 マーケティング・セールスプロモーション DX コラボレーション コンテンツビジネス 環境 大日本印刷株式会社 株式会社トーハン 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）と、株式会社トーハン（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：近藤敏貴）は、トーハン桶川センター（埼玉県桶川市）への書籍製造ライン導入に向けた協議を開始することで合意しました。取次の流通拠点内で書籍製造を行うことは、国内初の取り組みです。新たな製造ラインは、DNP久喜工場（埼玉県久喜市）のデジタル製造機械の一部を移設する予定で、2025年度中の運用開始を目指します。 ｢桶川書籍デジタル製造ライン｣導入検討について DNPとトーハンは、2021年に出版流通改革に向けた協業を開始しました。読者と市場の需要に応じた商品供給を強化し、書店等での欠品を減らすことで、販売機会の増大に繋げます。返品率が10%以下と言われるドイツの出版流通構造を参考に流通基盤を再整備し、現状30%を超える国内の返品率を低減します。また、返品する書籍の輸送や断裁等にともなう環境負荷の低減も視野に入れています。 こうした販売機会の増大等に向けて両社は今回、少部数から印刷するPOD（Print on Demand）技術を用いた「桶川書籍デジタル製造ライン」の新設を目指します。出版社と連携して、書籍製造用のコンテンツデータを預かり（コンテンツデータバンク構想＊に連動）、需要に応じて少部数にも対応した印刷・製本を行い、注文から短時間での出荷・販売を実現します。 全国の書店に配送する拠点であるトーハン桶川センターで書籍を製造することで、製造と流通の連動を強化し、デジタル印刷を取り入れた柔軟な供給体制を構築します。これにより、読者の満足度を高めるとともに書店や出版社の販売機会拡大を図ります。また、これまで一時的な欠品や供給過剰によって発生していた返品の削減につなげ、出版サプライチェーン上の各プレーヤーの収益構造を改善していきます。 重版未定や絶版の書籍を減らし、デジタル印刷により多様なコンテンツを柔軟かつ持続的に販売できる仕組みを構築することで、読者が多様なコンテンツに触れる機会を担保し、また著者に収益を還元して創出される商品を産み出し、供給の拡大にも貢献し、DNPとトーハンは出版文化のさらなる発展に寄与してまいります。 ＊コンテンツデータバンク構想 ： コンテンツのデータを一元管理して、ワンストップで製造・流通させるためのデータベースを構築する構想です。紙の書籍（オフセット印刷やデジタル印刷）に加え、音声や動画等のリッチコンテンツ、画像等を切り出したマイクロコンテンツなど、多様化するコンテンツの楽しみ方に合わせて展開することを目指しています。 各ステークホルダーに対する｢桶川書籍デジタル製造ライン」による提供価値 ○読者・生活者に対する提供価値 書店等での品切れが減り、入手できる時期も把握できるため、ストレスなく本が購入できる。 店頭での書籍検索時の、倉庫等を含めた在庫ヒット率が向上（現状の60％程度から90％程度に）。 ○書店に対する提供価値 店頭に該当書籍が無い場合も、読者に早期調達を約束できるため、書店のプレゼンスが向上。 販売機会ロスの削減される事での売上の増大 ○出版社に対する提供価値 重版未定や絶版の書籍を減らし、販売機会ロスの低減と収益の改善、著者への還元を強化。 書籍の現品やデジタル印刷用のデータなど、多様な在庫形態に柔軟に対応。 ※当製造ラインでの製造・供給に賛同されている出版社（2023年10月時点・五十音順）：河出書房新社、PHP研究所、扶桑社、ポプラ社。このほか20社以上と協議中。 ○取次（トーハン）における価値の創出 トーハン桶川センターの在庫の網羅性を向上。 非在庫商品についての出版社への調達件数が減ることで、注文から出荷までのリードタイムを短縮。 ○書籍製造（DNP）における価値の創出 製造決定ルート拡大（従来の出版社に加え、書店・取次からの発注にも対応）による製造の迅速化。 需要予測やデータ分析に基づく、より能動的な製造と適正な生産管理体制の構築。 今後の展開 DNPとトーハンは、「桶川書籍デジタル製造ライン」の実現に向けて、先行的に一部の出版社・書店と連携し、DNPの既存製造ラインでの試験的な製造と検証に取り組みます。また、デジタル印刷用のデータのラインアップの拡大に向けて「コンテンツデータバンク」を構築していくために、出版社や書籍製造会社との連携を強化します。 トーハンは新製造ラインの2025年度中の運用開始も視野に入れ、2024年夏をめどに桶川センターの在庫管理システムを全面的にリニューアルします。トーハン桶川センター全体が書籍デジタル製造ライン・桶川書籍流通センター（SRC）・ブックライナー（読者注文品専用の流通システム）とも連動することで、読者や書店の注文に対する「充足率の最大化」「調達リードタイムの最小化」を目指します。 両社は出版流通改革（出版デジタルトランスフォーメーション：DX）の実現に向けて、この構想にご賛同いただくパートナーの輪をさらに広げていきます。 ■参考：DNPとトーハンの協業による取り組み実績 トーハン桶川センターの機能向上と活用強化 ： 2022年2月に、DNPグループ書店で運用してきた書籍流通センターをトーハン桶川センターに移設し、流通リードタイム短縮（最短で注文当日出荷）を実現しています。また、出版社倉庫との在庫データ連携を拡大し、注文に対する100％の出荷を目指しています。2023年10月には、トーハン桶川センターにて、この取り組みにご賛同いただいた未来屋書店用の在庫管理システムの稼働を開始しました。 賛同書店の拡大 ： 生活者ニーズに基づく“マーケットイン”型の出版流通の検証～確立を推進するため、DNPグループ書店、未来屋書店に加え、出版流通改革にご賛同いただく書店・企業等の拡大に努めています。 小ロット製造による返本の低減など ： DNPはデジタル印刷を活用し、多品種・小ロット・短納期の書籍製造を実現しており、DNPの製造とトーハンの市場分析データを連動させた柔軟な書籍製造について、出版社等に提案しています。全体の製造数を抑えて返品率を下げるのではなく、注文に対する適正な数の書籍をきめ細かく製造することで、欠品による販売機会ロスや返品による出版社の収益ロスの低減を目指します。２０２２年に出版社と行った実証実験では、返品率２％削減、粗利４％増加という結果が得られ、出版社からは小ロット製造の具体的効果が高く評価されました。

"748",":Article","2023年10月20日 生活者一人ひとりに合わせた動画を作成・配信するサービスでIdomoo社と連携 「next generation video platform」の導入でセキュリティを強化して動画を生成 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス マーケティング・セールスプロモーション コラボレーション DX デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、企業等の顧客となる生活者の属性等の情報を活用し、一人ひとりに合わせた専用の動画メッセージを簡単に生成・配信するパーソナライズド動画サービスを提供するなど、企業等のマーケティング活動を支援しています。今回新たにIdomoo Ltd.（アイドゥム　本社：イスラエル）と協業し、同社が提供する「next generation video platform」を導入して、より安全・安心な環境でパーソナライズド動画の生成・配信を行えるサービスを、2023年10月20日（金）に販売を開始します。 DNPが提供している顧客コミュニケーション施策と本サービスを組み合わせ、新たなマーケティング施策を提供します。DNPは本サービスの販売で、2025年までに累計25億円の売上を目指します。 Idomoo社との協業の背景 Webを活用したマーケティングでは、企業等や生活者との“One to One”のコミュニケーションが注目されており、生活者個人の属性等の情報に応じて生成するパーソナライズド動画の需要が高まっています。従来、パーソナライズド動画の生成には、HTMLやJavaScriptを使ってテンプレート（基本パターン）の上に個人データ（テキスト・画像）をかぶせる「オーバーレイ技術」が使われていました。この手法は、個人データの書き換えが可能で、悪意を持って生活者のブラウザー側で編集が行われた場合など、意図しない内容に改ざんされるリスクがありました。また、動画内での個人データの配置場所が限定されるため、コンテンツ制作（クリエイティブ）の面で制約が生じていました。 こうした課題に対してDNPは今回、海外で主流となっている、個人データを直接埋め込んだ動画を生成する手法を使ったIdomoo社の「ネイティブパーソナライズド動画」を導入することで、よりセキュリティを強化し、高品質なパーソナライズド動画生成サービスを提供します。 「next generation video platform」によるパーソナライズド動画サービスの特長 ○高水準のセキュリティ環境で動画を生成 Idomoo社では、個人データを動画のテンプレートにかぶせる従来の「オーバーレイ技術」ではなく、個人データを直接埋め込んだ状態で動画を生成します。そのため、生成後に動画の内容を書き換えることが不可能となり、情報が改ざんされるセキュリティリスクが大きく低減されます。また、動画生成に用いる個人データには適切に暗号化処理を施し、動画生成後に即座に削除するなど、適切なデータ取り扱い方針に基づいて、高いセキュリティ環境を構築しています。 ○動画内容の個別化・最適化 企業等の顧客一人ひとりの氏名や利用するサービスの内容等の情報を表示する動画を瞬時に生成します。性別・年代・契約期間などの属性や条件に応じて、動画のシーンの選定や並び替えを自動で行うことで、数千万以上の対象者ごとに適したシナリオの動画を高速に生成・提供できます。また、企業の最新情報を常に自動で動画にアップデートすることができるため、対象者の情報や視聴環境などに応じて、それらの情報をリアルタイムで反映することも可能です。また作成時、プログラミングのコード入力が不要で、動画の作成時間を短縮できることに加え、個人データの配置場所などの制限がなく、柔軟性の高いデザインが可能となります。これにより、従来のオーバーレイ技術ではできなかった導入速度と動画演出を実現します。 ○インタラクティブ機能を実装 動画内に、アンケートの選択肢や、個別化した製品・サービスの案内ページや購入ページ、問合せ先等にリンクするボタン等を設置できます。顧客となる生活者自身の回答やクリックによって動画がインタラクティブに切り替わる、動画内でのアクションが他のシステムと連動するなど、より快適な動画体験の提供と行動喚起につながります。同時に、顧客のアクションを統計データとして収集し、動画設計の改善に活用できます。 DNPが提供するサービスとの連携による効果 DNPは高度なセキュリティ環境を活かして、企業等の顧客データの管理を軸としたさまざまなサービスを展開しています。本サービスと組み合わせることで、より個別に最適化された顧客コミュニケーションを実現します。例えば、ダイレクトメールにQRコードを印刷して発送し、そのQRコードを生活者がスマートフォン等のカメラで読み取った際に、個別に最適化された動画をリアルタイムで生成して表示する仕組みを構築するなど、紙をベースとしたマーケティング施策とデジタル領域のコミュニケーションを連動させます。 DNPのオンライン広告配信サービスやデジタルサイネージと、リアルタイムに動画を生成する機能を組み合わせることで、最適な広告配信を可能にします。Web上で取得できる利用者の行動履歴（閲覧履歴や閲覧時の場所や時間など)にもとづいて、個別の広告動画をリアルタイムで生成して表示することができます。また、サイネージを設置した店舗などの情報(在庫状況や商品価格の変動、イベント開催など)と連携させた動画を生成し表示することができます。 出版社や芸能事務所などのコンテンツホルダーと連携し、好きなキャラクターやアーティストなどが登場するオリジナルのコンテンツを生成することも可能です。ファンの満足度向上やコンテンツを活用した販促施策としてご利用いただけます。 Idomoo社 CRO Yaron Dishon氏からのコメント 「Idomooは、セキュリティと品質を最優先に考える企業からの信頼が厚く、アメリカのトップ5大銀行やUSAA、Zurichなどの主要保険会社に利用される、世界最先端のパーソナライズド動画プロバイダーです。DNPとの協業を通じて、彼らのデジタルマーケティングやセールスプロモーションの専門知識を活かし、日本のビジネスシーンで更に多くの企業にこの最先端のOne to Oneコミュニケーション手段を提供できることを楽しみにしています。」 参考: 本サービスの詳細はこちら　→　https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/20169835_1567.html ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。

"750",":Article","2023年10月19日 大日本印刷とセキュアワークス 日本企業が侵害されやすいサイバー攻撃の対策を学ぶ演習を共同で開発 体系化したガイドに準拠し、最新のサイバー攻撃の「検知・対応・復旧」を強化 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 認証・セキュリティ 認証・セキュリティ DX 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、サイバーセキュリティソリューションを提供するSecureworks, Inc.（米国、NASDAQ: SCWX）の日本法人・セキュアワークス株式会社と共同で、日本企業が侵害されやすいサイバー攻撃手法をシナリオに採用した体験型実践演習（ハンズオン）の「サイバー攻撃対処コース」を開発しました。 本コースには、仮想環境（サイバーレンジ）を使った体験型実践演習のシナリオに、セキュアワークスが提供する「Red Teamテスト」（実際のサイバー攻撃と同等の攻撃を仕掛けて、企業・組織のセキュリティレベルを評価するサービス）の知見を組み込んでいます。 受講者は演習を通じて、多くの日本企業に有効だったサイバー攻撃手法や最新トレンドを体験するとともに、脅威事象（インシデント）への組織的な対応能力について講義でも習得します。演習と講義の両面で、企業へのサイバー攻撃に対する「検知・対応・復旧」を強化します。 「サイバー攻撃対処コース」について → https://www.dnp.co.jp/cka/course/ir-fundamental-3days.html   【開発の背景】 増加し続ける標的型サイバー攻撃に対し、企業は侵入されることを前提として、被害を最小限に抑える対応が求められています。巧妙化・複雑化するサイバー攻撃やインシデントに対応する専門チーム・CSIRT（Computer Security Incident Response Team）は、多くの企業等が被害を受けたサイバー攻撃の手法や侵入された後の対応など、常に最新のトレンドを学び続ける必要があります。 DNPは、2016年からサイバーセキュリティ人材を育成する「サイバーナレッジアカデミー」を運用し、CSIRT等を対象とした体験型実践演習や経営層向け情報セキュリティ講習を実施しています。セキュアワークスは、グローバルで1日約6,100億件のイベント監視（2023年8月1日現在）、年間3,000件以上のインシデント対応とセキュリティテストのノウハウを生かして、企業のセキュリティ対策の有効性評価や改善策を提言するRed Teamテストを提供しています。日本でも2015年に「Red Teamテスト」の提供を開始し、多くの支援実績を重ねています。 今回、こうした両社の強みとサービス提供を通じて培ったノウハウ等を掛け合わせて、「サイバー攻撃対処コース」を開発しました。 【「サイバー攻撃対処コース」の特長】 １．最新で実効性のあるサイバー攻撃手法の演習 インシデント発生時に対応すべきことを理解するには、受講者が実際のサイバー攻撃の流れや最新の攻撃の戦術やテクニックを経験し、それによる影響を実感することが大切です。そのために今回、セキュアワークスの知見を踏まえた演習シナリオを準備し、DNPのサイバーレンジに組み込んで提供します。 受講者は一連の実践と解説を通じて、演習で体験するサイバー攻撃の手法や攻撃者の行動パターンを、アメリカの非営利団体・The MITRE Corporationが体系化したMITRE ATT&CK（Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge／マイターアタック）のフレームワークに基づいて理解し、それに対する予防策や対応策を学ぶことができます。 ２．国際的に使用されているNISTのフレームワークに準拠した講義 米国立標準技術研究所（NIST）が発行したフレームワーク・NIST SP800-61 rev.2は、組織がセキュリティインシデントの検知・対応・復旧を行うための手順やベストプラクティス（最善の方法）として、国際的に活用されています。今回のコースはNIST SP800-61 rev.2に準拠し、インシデント対応プロセスの全体像と検知・分析・封じ込め・根絶・復旧の詳細について、講義として提供します。サイバー攻撃の手法や影響を理解し、講義で体系的な知識を得ることで、受講者は自社のインシデント対応体制と手順を理解することができます。 【「サイバー攻撃対処コース」の概要】 ○コース名 ： サイバー攻撃対処コース_講義&実機演習_基礎_3日 ○対象者 ：

"752",":Article","2023年10月16日 ロボットとRFID（ICタグ）を活用した図書館向け蔵書点検サービスを開始 富士物流との共同開発で、蔵書点検の作業時間を8割以上削減 製品・サービス BPO・業務効率化 出版・電子出版・教育 DX 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は全国の図書館に向けて、RFID（ICタグ）を活用した蔵書点検サービスの提供を2023年10月24日に開始します。蔵書点検に関して、富士物流株式会社と共同で独自のロボットやシステムを開発し、作業時間を大幅に削減します。 また、本サービスを含む図書館向け蔵書点検サービスについて、2023年10月24日（火）～25日（水）にパシフィコ横浜で開催する「図書館総合展2023」（https://www.libraryfair.jp/）に出展します。 蔵書点検のロボット RFIDを活用した蔵書点検サービス開発の背景と狙い 図書館運営において、蔵書点検は「所蔵資料があるべき場所にあるか」「行方不明の資料はないか」を確認する年に一度の大切な作業です。この点検は、本に付与したバーコードやRFIDを手作業で読み取ることが多く、数か月前から計画を立て、1週間程度休館し作業を行ないます。休館による利用者への長期の利用制限の発生とともに、作業者の作業負荷や臨時雇用が必要になるなど、効率性の向上が課題となっています。 こうした課題の解決に向けてDNPは富士物流と共同で、RFIDを用いて様々な厚みや大きさの資料でも、作業時間を大幅に短縮する蔵書点検サービスを開発しました。 ■図書館におけるRFID導入と蔵書管理業務の状況(2023年9月現在、DNP調べ) RFID導入状況（国内公共図書館全体での割合） 蔵書管理の方法 読み取り速度（1人で1時間作業した場合） 未導入 7割以上 書籍のバーコードで管理。バーコードリーダーを使って、手作業で1冊ずつ読み取る。	 1,000～1,200冊程度 HF帯RFID導入 2割程度 HF帯RFIDを書籍に付与して管理。ハンディリーダーを使って、手作業で1冊ずつ読み取る。 ※リーダーを導入できず、バーコードでの管理となっている場合も多い 1,000～2,000冊程度 UHF帯RFID導入 1割未満 UHF帯RFIDを書籍に付与して管理。ハンディリーダーを使って、手作業で複数冊を同時に読み取る。 2,000～10,000冊程度 ※リーダーの性能による RFIDを活用した蔵書点検サービスのポイント 図書館への事前調査、作業設計と準備作業（蔵書点検ルートや手順等の設計、作業員や機材の確保等）、実際の蔵書点検作業の代行（蔵書点検作業～蔵書点検データ作成、不明本リストに基づく現物確認等）を実施します。 図書館ごとのRFIDの利用状況に応じて、効率的なスキャニング手法を提案します。 RFID未導入の図書館に向けた導入支援も行います。 各社の役割 ： DNPはサービス構築や機器仕様設計を行い、DNPのグループ会社である株式会社図書館流通センターと丸善雄松堂株式会社を通じてサービスを提供します。富士物流は、作業検証、点検作業、機器開発を行います。 ■参考価格 ：

DNPは本サービスを通じて、図書館職員の蔵書管理業務を効率化し、本の仕入れの最適化や利用者の利便性・満足度の向上を支援します。近年の図書館では、地域の人々をつなぎ、創発的な活動を生み出す場としての価値提供が図書館に求められており、そのための職員の教育やサービスの開発などにつなげていきます。 DNPはまた、UHF帯RFIDを活用し、図書館内の閲覧履歴を自動的に取得するシステムの開発も進めています。これにより館内でよく読まれる本のジャンルやテーマを可視化し、選書の効率化などにつなげることが可能になります。さらに、書店でのRFID導入の実証実験＊1にも活用していく予定です。DNPは、RFIDを活用した蔵書管理関連サービスで2027年度までに累計10億円の売上を目指します。 ＊1　DNPが運営するオープンイノベーション施設「DNPプラザ」（東京都新宿区）内の「外濠書店」では、2023年4月から本システムを用いた実証実験を実施しています。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。

"755",":Article","2023年10月11日 大日本印刷と東海理化　YKK APへ社用車に「飲んだら乗れない仕組み」を提供 アルコールチェック未実施での運転を防止し企業全体のコンプライアンス強化に貢献 製品・サービス 認証・セキュリティ モビリティ コラボレーション 認証・セキュリティ 大日本印刷株式会社 株式会社東海理化 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）と株式会社東海理化は、YKK AP株式会社へ、社用車管理の課題を解決する「DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey：ビーキー）」の提供を開始しました。2023年9月から順次、YKK APの全国約1,400台の車両と、約2,000人の従業員を対象に、本サービスを導入しています。 本サービスは、スマートフォンのアプリで社用車を簡単に予約できる上、アルコールチェック（飲酒検査）の結果が問題なかった場合のみ車両ドアが解錠します。自家用車と同じ白地のナンバープレートの車両を保有する事業者（白ナンバー事業者）のアルコールチェック義務化とコンプライアンス強化に貢献します。 （左）アルコールチェックのイメージ、（右）車両ドアを解錠するイメージ DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）導入の背景 2022年4月に道路交通法施行規則が改正され、飲酒運転の取り締まりが強化されました。白ナンバー車両を保有する事業者は、目視での運転前後のアルコールチェックと、記録の1年間の保管が義務付けられたことに加え、2023年12月1日（金）から検知器によるアルコールチェックが義務付けられます。 YKK APは、道路交通法の改正後すぐに対応を進めてきましたが、アルコール検査を実施しない場合でも社用車が運転できてしまうため、アルコールチェック実施漏れ発生の可能性といった運用上の課題を抱えていました。その課題に対して今回、アルコールチェック未実施の場合や、検査でアルコール量が基準値を超えた場合にドアを解錠させないDNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）の機能＊1が評価され、採用に至りました。同社は、「検査しないと乗せない」「飲んだら乗せない」という仕組みの導入により、コンプライアンスを強化していきます。 DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）の特長 ○DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）は、スマートフォンのアプリで簡単に社用車の利用予約を行えるほか、アルコール検知器による検査と記録、車両ドアの鍵の施解錠や日常点検などの記録が行える月額課金（サブスクリプション）型サービスです。 ○取り付け工事の必要がない車載デジタルキーボックスに自動車のスマートキーを格納し、スマートフォンから車両ドアの解錠・施錠ができます。 ○アルコール検知器での検査が未実施の場合、または検査でアルコール量が基準値を超えた場合は、スマートフォンでドアを解錠できず、物理的に運転をさせない環境を実現します。そのため、アルコール検査実施率の向上や飲酒運転の抑制などにつながり、コンプライアンス強化に寄与します。 ○ドアの施解錠の操作には、DNPがICカード事業で培った暗号鍵管理の技術を活用しています。 スマートフォンの画面イメージ 今後の展開 DNPと東海理化は、アルコールチェックが義務化される2023年12月1日までに、YKK APの全国250拠点で、DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）の導入を完了する予定です。またYKK APは、DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）の車両稼働集計機能＊2を活用して車両の稼働状況を可視化し、保有車両数の最適化を進めます。 ＊1　DNP社用車管理サービス（Bqey）の機能詳細についてはこちら https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/10162111_1567.html ＊2　予約情報と保有台数から日別の稼働率や車両別の稼働率を集計する機能。保有台数に対し、日別の稼働台数、時間別最大稼働台数を集計することで、現状の稼働率に対する保有台数の過不足をグラフで確認できます。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。

"756",":Article","2023年10月10日 環境省が認定する「自然共生サイト」にDNPの「市谷の杜」（東京都新宿区）が選定 生物多様性の保全が図られている区域として認定、地域在来種からなる緑地づくりが評価 サステナビリティ 社会からの評価 環境 環境 地域創生・まちづくり 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は今回、本社敷地内（東京都新宿区）で「都市における新しい森づくり」として育成している「市谷の杜」で、環境省による「自然共生サイト」の認定を取得しました。     「市谷の杜」から臨むDNP市谷加賀町ビル（左）と、DNPの市谷地区の全景（右） 環境省が認定する「自然共生サイト」について 環境省は、2021年6月のG7サミットで合意された「G7 2030年 自然協約（G7 2030 Nature Compact）」に基づき、2030年までに陸と海の30％以上を健全な生態系として効果的に保全することを目指す「30by30目標」を掲げています。この実現に向けて、国立公園等の保護地域の拡張に加え、里地・里山や企業林など、地域・企業・団体によって生物多様性の保全が図られている土地を「OECM（Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures）」として国際的なデータベースに登録して、その保全を促進しています。また2023年4月には、OECMに該当する「民間の取組等によって生物多様性の保全が図られている区域」を「自然共生サイト」として認定する制度を開始しています。 ＊環境省WebサイトURL ： https://www.env.go.jp/guide/info/ecojin/oecmsites/20230816.html DNPの取り組み DNPは、本社がある東京都新宿区の市谷地区で進めている都市再開発の一環で、人工地盤上の有効空地に「都市における新しい森づくり」として、「市谷の杜」を育てています。かつてこの地に広がっていた武蔵野の雑木林をイメージして、落葉広葉樹を中心に常緑樹を織り交ぜた多様性あふれる自然の森で、現在は総敷地面積の約3割に当たる15,000㎡を緑化しています。 今回、2023年度前期（申請受付期間2023年4月3日～5月8日）の第1回認定申請にて、DNPが推進する以下の取り組みが評価され、「市谷の杜」が「自然共生サイト」として認定されました。 大都市の再開発における自然創出のモデル的な取り組みになり得る事例である。 DNPグループ全体で、「環境保全と持続可能な社会の実現」に向けた取り組みを進めており、地区全体の再開発に際し、地域在来種を主体とした新たな緑地帯を造成する野心的な取り組みである。 社員が日々の観察で気づいたことを記録し、共有することで、緑地のモニタリングや管理に活かしている。 また、専門家の知見も取り入れながら、DNPの市谷地区を含めた新宿御苑や皇居などに続く緑地帯の生き物や自然環境にも配慮した適正な維持管理を継続し、100年後まで見据えた緑地づくりに取り組んでいることに、期待が寄せられました。 DNPは引き続き、自然共生社会の構築や、ネイチャーポジティブ（自然生態系の損失を食い止め回復させること）の実現に向けて、地域の人々とのコミュニケーションも深めながら、「市谷の杜」全体を成長させるとともに、より良い街づくりを進めていきます。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。","B-10","[""DNP"",""市谷の杜"",""保全"",""自然共生サイト"",""都市"",""市谷地区"",""新宿区"",""東京都"",""森づくり"",""敷地"",""環境省"",""地域在来種"",""認定"",""緑地づくり"",""取り組み"",""認定"",""選定 生物多様性"",""評価 サステナビリティ 社会"",""DNP市"",""評価 環境 環境 地域創生・まちづくり 大日本印刷株式会社"",""G7サミット"",""本社"",""区域"",""自然共生サイト"",""生物多様性"",""地域"",""保護地域"",""こと"",""再開発"",""/oecmsites/20230816.html DNP"",""*環境省"",""G7 2030年 自然協約"",""G7 2030 Nature Compact"",""谷加賀町"",""Webサイト"",""右"",""全景"",""左"",""ビル"",""生態系"",""実現"",""自然共生サイト"",""自然"",""地区全体"",""認定"",""陸"",""海"",""企業"",""企業林"",""里山"",""里地"",""自然環境"",""全体"",""OECM(Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures"",""国立公園"",""地域"",""緑地帯"",""区域"",""環境保全"",""本社"",""緑地"",""団体"",""拡張"",""データベース"",""土地"",""緑地づくり"",""緑地帯"",""多様性"",""こと"",""こと"",""制度"",""取組"",""民間"",""実現"",""森"",""こと"",""申請"",""以下"",""社会"",""一環"",""主体"",""こと"",""管理"",""モニタリング"",""自然共生社会"",""実現"",""管理"",""空地"",""人工地盤"",""地域在来種"",""事例"",""創出"",""常緑樹"",""武蔵野"",""DNPグループ"",""自然生態系"",""地"",""雑木林"",""落葉広葉樹"",""中心"",""面積"",""日々"",""社員"",""観察"",""登録商標"",""会社名"",""商標"",""御苑"",""街づくり"",""知見"",""維持"",""生き物"",""皇居"",""専門家"",""構築"",""申請受付期間"",""期待"",""ネイチャーポジティブ"",""人々"",""コミュニケーション"",""商品名"",""各社"",""損失"",""5月8日"",""100"",""2030年"",""2030年"",""2023年4月"",""2023年4月3日"",""2023年10月10日"",""2023"",""10"",""10"",""2021"",""6"",""2030"",""2030"",""2030"",""30"",""30"",""2023"",""4"",""20230816"",""3"",""15,000"",""15,000"",""2023"",""2023"",""4"",""3"",""5"",""8"",""1"",""2021年6月""]","0.0025994452124654495","0.003324296960920813","0.004338436464531835","0.002719559003895103","true","[0.117268,0.084243216,0.08282681,0.06039705,0.05430214,0.044992294,0.04064388,0.03536872,0.032599173,0.027588502,0.02726237,0.022763235,0.02053938,0.018626036,0.017999873,0.01682591,0.014468487,0.013969299,0.013012644,0.011180409,0.0111340815,0.009725936,0.009725936,0.009685192,0.007151446,0.005488455,0.005488455,0.004981808,0.004568327,0.0041441256,0.003830803,0.003292294,0.003292294,0.003292294,0.0030314876,0.0028418477,0.0028418477,0.0028418477,0.0028418477,0.0028102244,0.0027851285,0.002315398,0.0021885538,0.002127021,0.002098414,0.0020036248,0.0020036248,0.0018704208,0.0018704208,0.0018704208,0.0018704208,0.0016788424,0.0016513643,0.001544615,0.001544615,0.0015386518,0.0015240046,0.0015149162,0.0014563792,0.0014174473,0.0013701307,0.0013310029,0.0013310029,0.0013310029,0.0013310029,0.0013169887,0.0012442445,0.0012308405,0.0012035569,0.0012035569,0.0010772402,0.0010772402,0.0010772402,0.0010665068,0.00100978,9.23968E-4,9.205826E-4,9.205826E-4,9.093399E-4,8.5917267E-4,8.179526E-4,7.418584E-4,6.7090883E-4,6.7090883E-4,6.562307E-4,6.562307E-4,6.089899E-4,5.8291893E-4,5.8291893E-4,5.742434E-4,5.7086075E-4,5.7086075E-4,5.6254957E-4,5.6254957E-4,5.368949E-4,5.1460566E-4,4.8428646E-4,4.8428646E-4,4.8428646E-4,4.8428646E-4,4.8428646E-4,4.7625424E-4,4.7625424E-4,4.7625424E-4,4.7437477E-4,4.7437477E-4,4.7437477E-4,4.629311E-4,4.5901115E-4,4.5767007E-4,4.322456E-4,4.322456E-4,4.322456E-4,4.322456E-4,4.285847E-4,4.139954E-4,3.989998E-4,3.6518375E-4,3.6518375E-4,3.6518375E-4,3.3660672E-4,3.3660672E-4,3.04102E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","/Users/smallcat/Documents/GitHub/graph/dnp/kg/data/newsrelease_B-1-100_C-1-4/B-10.txt",,,,,,,
"757",":Article","2023年10月6日 エイベックスと連携　現代アートのサブスクリプションサービスを開始 高精彩複製原画によるアート体験を企業に向けて提供、若手アーティストの支援にも貢献 製品・サービス 企業コミュニケーション デザイン コラボレーション コンテンツビジネス 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）グループの株式会社DNPメディア・アート（DMA）は、エイベックス・クリエイター・エージェンシー株式会社（ACA）と連携し、現代アートのサブスクリプション（定期・継続型）サービス「CONTEMPORARY（コンテンポラリー）」の提供を2023年10月6日（金）に開始します。 ■CONTEMPORARYサービスページ：https://ctpr.jp/ 提供作品の例 「CONTEMPORARY」のクリエイティブイメージ 現代アートのサブスクリプションサービス開始の背景 社会や暮らしの変化が加速し、将来の予測が難しい不確実な時代と言われるなかで、ビジネスや社会活動におけるアートやアーティストの重要性が高まっています。例えば、企業がアートをオフィスに取り入れることは、社員に対するアートを通じた社風の表現や、既成概念にとらわれずに価値を生み出す「アート思考」の促進に加えて、働く環境や組織風土、社員のエンゲージメントの向上につながります。しかし、企業がアート作品を独自に選んで定期的に購入することは、適切な購入ルートや作家の選定などのノウハウが必要なため非常に困難です。一方、特に若手のアーティスト等がアート領域での活動を持続的に行うため、十分な資金調達等が可能な新しいビジネスモデルが求められていました＊1。 こうした企業側とアーティスト側の双方の課題の解決に向けて、DMAとACAは今回、企業に向けて現代アートを定期的に提供するサービス「CONTEMPORARY」を展開します。 現代アートのサブスクリプションサービスのポイント ACAが運営するアートプロジェクト「MEET YOUR ART」＊2が企画し、DMAが「DNP高精彩出力技術 プリモアート®」＊3で制作する現代アーティストの「版画／高精彩複製画」（A0サイズ：841mm×1189mm）を、1年に3回提供する企業向けサブスクリプションサービスです。企業は本サービスを通じて、オフィス等に最新のアートを設置し、社員や顧客にアート体験を提供できます。 1億画素のカメラの活用や職人の技術により、原画の色調や筆致などの質感を限りなく忠実に再現した高品質な版画を提供します。また、原画とは違って保管責任を問われることがないため、比較的低いリスクでアートを保有できます。 サービス利用料金の一部（各作品の制作費の50%）を参加アーティストに還元し、若手を中心としたアーティストの支援につなげます。 サービスを利用する企業に対し、Webサイト等に掲載できる公式のパートナーバナーの素材を提供します。企業はこのバナーの掲載によって、アートの活用やアーティストの支援を行っていることを対外的にアピールし、企業ブランディングの向上に活用することができます。 今後の展開 DNPグループはACAと協業し、これらの取り組みを通じて現代アート作品の版画の普及に努めるとともに、生活者や企業への価値の提供とアーティストへの収益還元を循環させるエコシステムの構築を目指します。 ＊1　経済産業省／「アートと経済社会について考える研究会報告書」： https://www.meti.go.jp/shingikai/mono_info_service/art_economic/pdf/20230704_1.pdf ＊2　「MEET YOUR ART」は、YouTubeのアート専門番組を中心に、ネットショップやフェスティバルなどを複合的に展開するアートプロジェクトです。アート専門番組でのアーティストインタビューや現代アートに関する知識の紹介、番組で紹介したアーティストの作品が購入できるネットショップの運営、アートを中心としたミックスカルチャーフェスティバルの開催などを通して、‘新たな手法で、多くの方へアートに触れるきっかけや、特に若手のアーティストを知る機会を創出すること’を理念に活動しています。

ONE（フェーズワン）」を使用し、作品の色調や筆致、キャンバスや紙の目まで忠実に読み取り、限りなく原画に近い再現性のある作品に仕上げます。 https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/1193231_1567.html ＜エイベックス・クリエイター・エージェンシー株式会社の概要＞ https://avexcreatoragency.com/

"758",":Article","2023年10月6日 札幌国際芸術祭2024（SIAF2024） イニシアティブ・パートナーとして参画 チケットの電子化などの来場者管理のDX化でシームレスな会場移動を実現 製品・サービス マーケティング・セールスプロモーション 認証・セキュリティ 環境 コラボレーション データ流通 地域創生・まちづくり DX 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、2024年1月20日（土）～2月25日（日）に開催される「札幌国際芸術祭（Sapporo International Art Festival：SIAF）2024」にイニシアティブ・パートナー＊1として参画します。 ＊1　イニシアティブ・パートナーは、本イベントで社会課題にともに向き合い、未来志向で解決に取り組むことに共鳴する企業6社。 「SIAF2024」は、アルスエレクトロニカ・フューチャーラボの小川秀明共同代表のディレクションのもと、市民に開かれた“創造エンジン”としての芸術祭の実現を目指しています。DNPはこの考えに共感して本イベントに参画し、デジタルチケットの発券や効果的な情報発信などを組み合わせて、運営側・参加者双方の負荷を軽減するシームレスな（途切れのない）会場移動の支援を行います。従来の紙のチケットでは困難だった来場者の動向把握をデジタルチケットによって実現し、混雑の緩和やマーケティングへの活用につなげます。また、各会場への誘導サインを環境に配慮したサステナブルな資材で制作するなど、サーキュラーエコノミー（循環経済）の実現にも取り組んでいく予定です。 DNPは「SIAF2024」への参画を通じて、シームレスな来場誘導などでイベント運営を強化するとともに、札幌市の文化振興事業の支援につなげていきます。 「札幌国際芸術祭2024」（SIAF2024）公式ロゴ ○会場 ： 未来劇場（東1丁目劇場施設）、さっぽろ雪まつり大通2丁目会場、札幌文化芸術交流センター SCARTS、北海道立近代美術館、モエレ沼公園、札幌芸術の森美術館 他　（未来劇場、北海道立近代美術館、札幌芸術の森美術館は有料となります） ○会期 ： 2024年1月20日（土）～2月25日（日）（37日間） ※さっぽろ雪まつり大通2丁目会場の会期は2024年2月4日（日）～2月11日（日・祝） ※札幌芸術の森美術館の会期は2023年12月16日（土）～2024年3月3日（日） ○公式WebサイトURL ： https://2024.siaf.jp/ DNPの強みを活かしたシームレスな（途切れのない）会場誘導の取り組み ○デジタルチケットの導入 2次元コードを利用したデジタルチケットの発券システムを導入します。このシステムによって各有料会場で来場者データを取得し、個人を特定しない匿名の状態に換えてマーケティング情報として分析し、次回の「SIAF」のほか、札幌市が主催するさまざまな事業に活用していく予定です。 ○人流データを活用した行動分析 国内の約6千万人がスマートフォン等のアプリの利用を通じて提供する位置情報と、約500万件の場所のデータをマッチングさせて、匿名の状態で来場者の行動を可視化します。こうした“人流ビッグデータ”を用いて、「SIAF」の各会場に向かう来場者を抽出し、各会場までのルート（スタート地点・滞在地・訪問先等）を明らかにすることで、「SIAF」の運営面の課題解決に寄与していきます。この取り組みには、DNPがNear（ニアー）社（本社：米国カリフォルニア州）と協業して展開している「人流データを活用したマーケティングサービス」＊2を活用します。

MAPベース地域振興情報発信プラットフォーム」＊3を活用します。各会場が発信するSNSの情報等を地図上に表示するなど、来場者に伝わりやすい形でリアルタイムに最新情報の発信を行います。 ＊3　「DNP MAPベース地域振興情報発信プラットフォーム」について → https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/10162666_1567.html

"759",":Article","2023年10月5日 内部情報漏えいに関する自社の対策強化とサービスの提供を開始 自社の導入ノウハウを活かしてグループ会社のインテリジェント ウェイブとともに各社を支援 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 認証・セキュリティ サステナビリティ 情報セキュリティ 認証・セキュリティ 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：北島義斉　以下：DNP）は、内部情報漏えいへの対策強化として、決済・セキュリティ関連のシステム開発を行うグループ会社の株式会社インテリジェント ウェイブ（以下：IWI）が開発したSaaS（Software as a Service）型の「CWATクラウド＊1」の導入を2023年10月に開始しました。また、今回の社内導入等で培ったノウハウを活かし、DNPとIWIは企業・団体等に向けて、「CWATクラウド」とそのオンプレミス版の「CWAT＊2」の販売や導入・運用のサポートも開始します。   「CWATクラウド」と「CWAT」の概要イメージ 【取り組みの背景】 近年、企業の内部情報漏えいが大きな課題となり、独立行政法人情報処理推進機構による「情報セキュリティ10大脅威 2023」＊3の上位にも挙がっています。社員等による競合他社等への機密情報の提供や悪用は、その企業等の社会的信用の失墜や損害賠償などにつながり、経営の根幹を揺るがす恐れがあります。こうした事案での社員への嫌疑に対しては、事案発生後のPC端末等のログ調査が一般的であり、発生前に常時監視することはこれまで困難でした。 こうした課題に対して今回DNPは、社員のPC操作の検知、重要ファイルへのアクセス制御、監視やログ管理等の機能を備えるIWIの「CWATクラウド」を導入しました。DNPは社内導入にあたり、部門ごとの利便性の確保とセキュリティの強化を両立させながら、当ソリューションの導入・運用に関する知見・ノウハウを獲得してきました。この知見・ノウハウを強みとして、IWIとともに、企業・団体等への「CWATクラウド」の販売と導入支援を開始します。 【「CWAT」と「CWATクラウド」の特長】 １．PC端末の操作ログ等から内部不正への対策を施すソリューション 「CWAT」は、PC端末を監視することで、情報漏えいにつながる操作を制御する内部不正対策ソリューションです。PC端末の操作ログを記録することで、企業・団体等の情報資産（人事・個人情報、財務情報、顧客情報、経営情報、営業秘密等）を漏えいの危険から「守る」、漏えいしていないことを「証明する」、漏えい事故につながる行為を「突き止める」ことができます。 ２．14種類のセキュリティポリシーで情報漏えい経路を監視・制御 セキュリティを強化すると業務効率は下がるという“トレードオフ”の関係にならないように、「CWAT」ではセキュリティポリシーを柔軟に設計できます。「特定の操作の禁止」や「端末にポップアップメッセージを表示して注意を促す」などの14種類の設定で、利用者の行為を制御することができます。各職場の業務や状況に合わせて、監視・制御のレベルを調整できます。 ３．リアルタイムで違反を通知する「警告ログ」とPC操作履歴を記録する「監査ログ」 「CWAT」はセキュリティポリシーに反した操作をリアルタイムで通知する「警告ログ」と、PC操作履歴を記録する「監査ログ」を別々に保存します。「警告ログ」では、監視・制御したい特定の操作をセキュリティポリシーで設定することで、不審な操作をリアルタイムに把握できます。また、「監査ログ」として全てのPC操作履歴を記録するため、この2種類のログの組み合わせによって、ポリシーに反した操作の前後の挙動を効率的に検索できて、迅速な証跡調査につながります。 ４．暗号化機能とキーワードチェック機能で外部へ持ち出されるファイルも保護 PC端末の制御機能に加え、ファイル（情報）保護の観点から、暗号化とキーワードチェックの機能を提供します。「CWAT」が動作しない環境ではファイルの暗号化と復号ができないように設定できます。また、キーワードチェック機能として、各部門で設定した特定の文字列がファイル名やファイル内に含まれる場合に、持ち出し操作を監視・制御することができます。（DNPの内部情報漏えいへの対策強化では、暗号化機能を導入していません） ５．クラウド型のサービス提供でリモートワーク等のオフィス外利用時にもセキュリティを強化 管理用サーバーを自社内に構築することなく、PC端末に監視エージェントを入れるだけで利用できます。また、リモートワーク中のポリシー違反操作についても、クラウド上の管理サーバーにリアルタイムに通知されて、制御が実行されるため、端末利用状況の可視化とセキュリティ強化を同時に実現することができます。 【今後の展開】 DNPは、IWIと共にエネルギー関連企業や製造業、製薬企業へ「CWAT」などを提供していき、関連サービスを含めて2025年度までに累計20億円の売上を目指します。また、DNPとIWIは引き続き、企業の内部情報漏えい対策を強化するとともに、サイバー攻撃対策ソリューション等の幅広いセキュリティソリューションの提供もさらに拡充していきます。 ＊1　「CWATクラウド」について →

"760",":Article","2023年10月5日 DNPプラザで「見かたを変える、ふしぎな恐竜展」を開催 リアルとバーチャルの融合や人気マンガ「ディノサン」とのコラボレーションなどで“ふしぎ体験”を！ イベント コラボレーション デザイン メタバース 教育 コンテンツビジネス 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、独自の多様なソリューションを活かして恐竜の魅力を伝える企画展「見かたを変える、ふしぎな恐竜展」を2023年10月20日（金）～2024年1月13日（土）に、自社が運営するオープンイノベーションの拠点「DNPプラザ」（東京・市谷）で開催します。 「見かたを変える、ふしぎな恐竜展」のメインビジュアル DNPは、AR（拡張現実）やVR（仮想現実）等のXR（Extended Reality）の技術や高精細な表現技術、情報処理の強みなどを活用して、リアルとデジタルの空間を安全かつシームレスにつなぎ、より豊かなコミュニケーションを実現する「XRコミュニケーション®事業」を展開しています。来場者は、こうしたXR技術や人気マンガ「ディノサン」＊1とのコラボレーションによるさまざまな“ふしぎな”体験を通して、恐竜の魅力を身近に・多面的に感じていただけます。 なお本企画展は、副業の制度を使って、社外で「恐竜コンサルタント」として働くDNP社員・宮澤悠大が企画・プロデュースを担当しています＊2。 「見かたを変える、ふしぎな恐竜展」の主なコンテンツのポイント ◯リアルな空間に恐竜がバーチャルに出現するふしぎ体験を提供！ DNPプラザの空間にブラキオサウルスなどの恐竜が登場！スマートフォンのブラウザを通じてAR体験を可能とする「Web AR」を活用することで、現代の建物の中に恐竜が現れるというバーチャル体験ができます。また、3Dプリンターで作成した恐竜たちの模型も展示します。なお、イラストレーター・加藤愛一氏＊3が制作した恐竜3Dデータを使用しています。 ◯人気マンガ「ディノサン」とコラボ！　恐竜も生き物、みんなも恐竜の飼育員になってみよう！ 「月刊コミックバンチ」（新潮社）で連載中の人気マンガ「ディノサン」（木下いたる著）＊2とのコラボレーション企画を展開します。 ①	「ディノサン」の世界が動き出す「ライトアニメ」のコンテンツを上映！ DNP独自のアニメーション制作手法「ライトアニメ」＊4を使って制作した、「ディノサン」の世界が動き出すコンテンツを上映します。「ライトアニメ」はマンガ原稿の活用を基本として、セリフの吹き出し等を削除した原稿からコマやパーツを切り出してカラー化し、モーションを加えて動画にする手法で、制作期間とコストを大幅に抑えます。今回の「ディノサン」アニメでは、マンガのメッセージそのままに、迫力のある恐竜たちが人間と同じ“生き物”であることを伝えます。 ②	「ディノサン」の舞台「江の島ディノランド」をバーチャルに体験できる「見どころキューブ」！ 「ディノサン」の舞台となる架空の恐竜テーマパーク「江の島ディノランド」を、DNP独自の鑑賞システム「みどころキューブ」＊5を用いて再現します。「みどころキューブ」は、立方体（キューブ）状のインタフェースを用いた直感的な操作で、多様な切り口で情報が紹介される鑑賞システムです。今回は、「江の島ディノランド」内の恐竜の飼育エリアや生態などを、キューブを使って“多面的に”紹介します。 ③　作中のメニューや新開発のオリジナルメニューを提供！ DNPプラザ内の飲食コーナー「問いカフェ」で、「ディノサン」とコラボした特別メニューを提供します。作中に出てくるメニューや、本企画展のために開発したオリジナルメニューを販売します。 各提供時間帯は、フードメニュー：11:30～15:00、ドリンク・デザート：11:30～19:30です。 ◯“見る”だけでなく、自分で”作る”恐竜展！ 恐竜展のミニチュア展示が、専用の画像認識技術とVR技術により、原寸大比率の展示会場となって画面に現れます。参加者が、恐竜や壁、草木、岩などのミニチュアパーツを自由にレイアウトすることで、 “自分だけの恐竜展”をイメージして、バーチャル空間に表現できる未来型のクリエイティブ企画です。 ◯展示を見たあとは思い出も持ち帰ろう！ 会場内のフォトブースでは、ここだけでしか撮れない「ディノサン」オリジナルフレームを使った記念撮影が可能です。 ◯恐竜本の特集コーナー DNPプラザ内にて、恐竜の書籍を集めた特設コーナーを展開します。 ■開催概要 会期 ： 2023年10月20日（金）～2024年1月13日（土） 会場 ： DNPプラザ　：東京都新宿区市谷田町1-14-1 DNP市谷田町ビル /

"761",":Article","2023年10月4日 ECブランドの育成と販売支援を行うACROVEと資本業務提携 D2C事業向けEC売上最大化を支援するサービスの強化や自社EC事業の拡大を目指す ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 決済・EC マーケティング・セールスプロモーション BPO・業務効率化 DX 大日本印刷株式会社（以下：DNP）は、電子商取引（EC）サイトを実施するブランドの育成と売上拡大等の販売支援を行う株式会社ACROVE（アクローブ）と、2023年9月29日に資本業務提携を行いました。 両社は、互いが持つ技術やノウハウ、サービスや機能を組み合わせ、企業が自社のECサイトやモール型ECで直接生活者に商品・サービスを販売する「Direct to Consumer（D2C）」事業の立ち上げや成長を支援するサービスの拡充、新サービスの開発を推進します。また、各種ECサイトの運営等に関するBPO（Business Process Outsourcing：業務委託）サービスなども展開していきます。   【ACROVEとの資本業務提携の背景と狙い】 国内の生活者向けEC市場が2022年に約22.7兆円＊1に拡大する（前年比9.91％増）一方で、国内の物販系分野の関係のEC化率は約9.13%＊2と諸外国・地域と比べて低く、今後もEC市場の拡大やメーカー等の参入が期待されています。特に近年、メーカー等がECサイトを開設して、商品の販売動向等を分析し、生活者のフィードバックを得て商品の改善・開発に取り組むD2C事業が増加しています。 こうした中でDNPは、「ECサイト・通販業務支援システム CommerceLine® SP」や「D2C支援サービス」＊3、ECサイトでの注文受付から配送までのフルフィルメント業務のBPOなど、大規模なECサイトの運営・保守の支援、各種EC対応サービスの提供などを行っています。 ACROVEは、ECモール上の商品情報・モールの市場動向等のビッグデータ分析を元に、再現性の高い売上最大化を支援するECプラットフォーム事業を推進しています。また、ブランド・事業価値向上を目的としたM&Aを実施する“ECロールアップ事業”を展開するなど、ECサイトの立ち上げから運営まで一貫してサービスを提供し、豊富な知見を有していることに強みがあります。 両社は今回の資本業務提携により、これらの強みを掛け合わせて、EC事業の立ち上げや成長の支援、フルフィルメント業務の運営代行など、各企業のEC事業の成長に応じた適切な支援を行います。 【資本業務提携による主な取り組みのポイント】 １．「D2C事業」向けEC支援サービスの強化と新サービスの開発 DNPは、DM・カタログ・電話・メール等を用いて生活者とのコミュニケーションを行うインサイドセールスやフルフィルメント等のBPO、およびリアルな店頭やイベント等と連動したプロモーション施策に強みがあります。ACROVEは、日々のEC運用を通して蓄積された、ビッグデータを元にした支援や、EC販売を中心としたブランドの育成、売上最大化を支援するコンサルティング、ECサイト上での転売対策などに強みがあります。両社は今回の協業によって強みを掛け合わせ、それぞれのサービスを互いに販売する体制を整え、D2C事業に取り組む企業等へのEC支援サービスを強化します。また、企業等のニーズに合わせた新しいサービスも開発していきます。 ２．自社EC運営事業における協業 ACROVEは、ブランドを育成し、価値向上を目的にECブランドの買収・統合から事業継承型M&Aまで実現するECロールアップ事業の実績とノウハウを有しており、DNPも複数の自社ECサイトの運営を行っています。両社は、効果的なEC運営のノウハウ・知見を活かして、ECブランドのロールアップ事業などに取り組んでいきます。 ３．さまざまな企業のEC事業の成長段階に合わせた支援体制を構築 両社は連携を深めることで、企業等がEC事業の成長段階に応じて抱える多様な課題に対して、柔軟に解決していく体制を構築していきます。またDNPは、EC事業に関連する豊富な知見を有するACROVEとの連携により、専門人材の育成やサービス提供体制の強化を図ります。 【今後の展開】 DNPはACROVEとの連携によって、モール型ECの運営・強化を目指す顧客に対して、サイトの立ち上げや運用のアウトソーシングの支援を開始します。これらのEC支援サービスや、関連サービスも含めて2025年度までに累計12億円の売上を目指します。 大日本印刷株式会社　　所在地：東京都新宿区　代表取締役社長：北島義斉 株式会社ACROVE　　所在地：東京都千代田区　代表取締役（CEO）：荒井俊亮

"763",":Article","2023年10月3日 高い透明性と導電性を両立した透明導電フィルムを開発 マイクロ波を用いた直径11ナノメートルの銀ナノワイヤーにより、フィルムの高性能化を実現 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス ディスプレイ部品・部材 次世代通信 モビリティ 大日本印刷株式会社 マイクロ波化学株式会社 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京都、代表取締役社長：北島義斉、以下：DNP）とマイクロ波化学株式会社（本社：大阪府、代表取締役社長CEO：吉野巌、以下：MWCC）は、マイクロ波の照射によってナノメートル（nm：10-9メートル）レベルを実現した銀の導電性繊維（銀ナノワイヤー）を用いて、高い透明性と導電性を両立した透明導電フィルムを開発しました。DNPは、2023年12月に本製品のサンプル提供を開始します。今後、両社は、DNPの光学フィルムと組み合わせた各種センサー用途での提供を目指します。 銀ナノワイヤー分散液とFE-SEM画像 銀ナノワイヤーフィルム ■今回開発した透明導電フィルムの特徴 従来、透明導電フィルムでは、一般的にPETフィルムにITO（Indium Tin Oxide：酸化インジウムスズ）などの導電性金属酸化物を高密度で均一に薄膜形成するために、真空中での成膜や、さらには高温焼結などの工程を経る必要があります。また、ITO膜はそれ自体に柔軟性がなく、急な温度変化などでは導電部でのひび割れが発生するおそれがあり、加工性や耐久性の懸念がありました。今回、DNPでは独自のインキ配合とウェット方式による精密塗工技術の組み合わせにより、銀ナノワイヤーを低温で、かつ均一に薄膜形成した透明導電フィルムの開発に成功しました。低温成膜により基材の選択の自由度が高まるとともに、繊維状材料を用いていることから、ITOと比較して高い耐久性やフレキシブル性を有しています。さらに、今回開発した透明導電フィルムは直径約11nmの非常に細い銀ナノワイヤーを適用しているため、可視光や近赤外光において非常に高い透過率と低い拡散反射率※1を実現しています。例えば、シート抵抗が30~70Ω/sq.(オーム毎スクエア :単位面積あたりの抵抗)の範囲において、ITOと比較して高い透明性を維持できます。また、透明導電フィルムに通電させることで、効率的にフィルム自体を発熱させることもできます。本開発により、LiDAR※2に透明フィルムヒーターを適用した場合、凍結や結露を防止でき、また拡散反射低減により、検出感度が向上します。これにより、寒冷地などでも安全な自動運転社会を実現します。 ■透明導電フィルム開発の背景 透明導電フィルムは、光の透過率が高く、優れた視認性と導電性を両立させた薄膜です。本用途の材料として、銀ナノワイヤーが高い導電性や透明性の観点から注目されています。左記性能は繊維状の銀ナノワイヤーのアスペクト比を高めることにより、さらに向上させることが可能ですが、従来技術では達成することが困難でした。この課題に対してMWCCは、銀に直接マイクロ波を照射する結晶制御技術を改良し、結晶を長さ方向に成長させて、アスペクト比の高い極細の銀ナノワイヤーの生産技術を確立しました。本プロセスは選択的に銀ナノワイヤーへエネルギーを伝達しているため、従来法に比べ効率的かつ大幅なCO2削減が可能となります。 ■今後の展開 DNPは、本製品のサンプル提供を2023年12月に開始します。また、DNPが強みを持つ反射防止フィルムや液晶位相差フィルム等の機能性光学フィルムと組み合わせることで、ディスプレイ分野に加え、車両・自動運転用LiDARや通信分野おいても、透明フィルムヒーターや電磁波シールドといった新たな機能を提供します。 なお、DNPは、2023年10月4日（水）～6日（金）に幕張メッセで開催される高機能素材Weekの「第14回フィルムテックジャパン（高機能フィルム展）」のカンファレンスで、「大日本印刷の機能性フィルムの現状と将来展望」についてDNPフェローの中村 典永が講演を行い、本製品についても紹介します。 ※1　拡散反射率：正反射光を除く、光の反射率を指す。光を吸収しない透明な物体でも、内部で光散乱を起こして透明性が低下することがあり、銀ナノワイヤーはフィルムの白さが大きな課題となっていました。この課題に対して、銀ナノワイヤー径を極細にすることで高い透明性と導電性の両立を可能にしました。 ※2　LiDAR(Light Detection and Ranging)：レーザー光を照射して、その反射光の情報をもとに、対象物までの距離や対象物の形などを計測する技術。

"764",":Article","2023年9月29日 国内5か所の美術館を巡回する「石岡瑛子 Ｉ（アイ） デザイン」展の企画・運営に協力 石岡瑛子氏の革新的な創作の魅力を伝える美術展を北九州市立美術館からスタート ニュースリリース イベント デザイン 公益財団法人DNP文化振興財団、株式会社DNPアートコミュニケーションズが企画・運営に協力している美術展「石岡瑛子 Ｉ（アイ） デザイン」が、2023年9月9日（土）に福岡県北九州市で開幕しました。この後、2025年6月までに、茨城県近代美術館・兵庫県立美術館・島根県立石見美術館・富山県美術館に巡回する予定です。 DNP文化振興財団は、大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）グループが強みとする印刷技術を活かした芸術文化であるグラフィックデザイン／グラフィックアートの普及・振興をめざして、さまざまな活動を展開しています。今回は初めて、アートと暮らしをつなぐ事業を行うDNPのグループ会社、DNPアートコミュニケーションズと連携し、国内5か所の美術館を巡回する展示企画を実施します。 「石岡瑛子 Ｉ（アイ） デザイン」展ポスター（Design　Nagai Hiroaki） 【巡回展開催の背景】  DNP文化振興財団は2020年に、石岡氏が1980年代にニューヨークへ渡るまでの日本での仕事に焦点を当てた企画展「SURVIVE － 石岡瑛子　グラフィックデザインはサバイブできるか」をギンザ・グラフィック・ギャラリー（ggg）＊1で開催しました。同時期に東京都現代美術館で開催された石岡氏の回顧展との相乗効果などで多くの反響があり、この企画展は京都dddギャラリー＊2にも巡回しました。しかし当時は、コロナ禍の影響もあってギャラリーへの来訪を控えた方も多かったと考えられます。そのため、全国のより多くの方々に石岡氏の魅力を知ってほしいとの思いから、今回の巡回展を開催することとしました。 本展は、gggと京都dddギャラリーでの石岡瑛子展の監修者3名（石岡怜子氏、河尻亨一氏、永井裕明氏）に引き続き監修いただき、両ギャラリーの展示コンセプトを基盤に再構成しています。河尻氏は、2012年の石岡氏の没後、長い年月をかけて石岡氏についての研究調査を行い、その一環で2015年度DNP文化振興財団の研究助成制度を活用しています。それらの活動の集大成として2020年に上梓した「TIMELESS　石岡瑛子とその時代」（朝日新聞出版）は、2021年に毎日出版文化賞（主催：毎日新聞社）を受賞しました。  【石岡瑛子 Ｉ（アイ） デザイン」展】  ○主な展示内容 ： 石岡氏が東京を拠点に活動していた1960年～80年代の仕事を中心に、ポスター約150点をはじめ、コマーシャルフィルム、レコードジャケット、ブックデザイン、アートワークなど約500点の作品を公開します。また、約50点の代表作には石岡氏による名言を対置させ、創作への情熱を伝えるだけでなく、大型インスタレーション（赤テント）内でCMの他、映像も上映し、時代の空気感まで再現しています。  ○主催 ： 巡回展を開催する各美術館  ○特別協力 ： 公益財団法人DNP文化振興財団、株式会社DNPアートコミュニケーションズ  ○企画協力 ： 迫村裕子（S2株式会社）  ○監修 ： Team EIKO（石岡怜子、河尻亨一、永井裕明（N.G. inc.））  ○図録制作 ： 朝日新聞出版　  北九州市立美術館における「石岡瑛子 Ｉ デザイン」展の様子

"766",":Article","2023年9月28日 サイバー攻撃に備えた組織連携トレーニングをメタバース上で実施するコースを開発 企業の経営・マネジメント層を対象にインシデント発生時の対応経験を提供 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 認証・セキュリティ XR 認証・セキュリティ DX メタバース 教育 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、企業の経営・マネジメント層を対象に、インターネット上の仮想空間・メタバースで、複数の部門が連携してセキュリティ上の脅威事象（インシデント）発生時の緊急対応と組織間連携を学べる「組織連携コース_メタバース演習＊1」を開発しました。 本演習は、インシデント発生の際に対応指示等の責任を持つ経営・マネジメント層のメンバー4人が、それぞれの役割（ロール）に分かれて、メタバースで実施するものです。インシデント発生時に取るべき行動や組織連携のあり方について、場所の制約なく学ぶことができます。 DNPは本日より受講申し込み受付を開始し、11月8日（水）よりサイバーセキュリティ人材育成サービス「サイバーナレッジアカデミー」の新しいコースとして提供を開始します。 ＊1　組織連携コース_メタバース演習について → https://www.dnp.co.jp/cka/course/interorg-comm-training01.html 組織連携コース_メタバース演習のイメージ 組織連携コース_メタバース演習　受講イメージ 【開発の背景】 インシデント発生時は、ITシステム担当の情報システム部門に加え、被害を受けた事業の継続判断を行う事業部門、ステークホルダーへの状況の説明を担う広報部門など、複数部門間の連携と判断・対処が必要です。特に各組織の意思決定層が適切な連携と判断・対処を行うには、防災訓練や避難訓練と同様に、サイバー攻撃の被害を想定し、「机上演習」を事前に実施するなど、平時からの備えが不可欠です。 DNPは、2016年からサイバーセキュリティ対策要員を育成する「サイバーナレッジアカデミー」を運用し、CSIRT（Computer Security Incident Response Team）等の実務者を対象とした教育や、「経営層向け情報セキュリティ講習」などを行っています。これらの知見・ノウハウと、DNPが2023年7月に提供を開始し「ロールプレイング型のメタバース構築サービス」＊2の強みを掛け合わせ、今回、企業・団体向けに、対話しながらインシデント発生時の組織連携について学ぶ演習を開発しました。 【「組織連携コース_メタバース演習」の特長】 １．各部門の情報連携や意思決定を体感で学ぶ演習 情報セキュリティの責任者であるCISO（Chief Information Security Officer）やCSIRT長・事業部長・広報部長の役割に分かれ、4人一組で各人のPCからメタバースの演習室にアクセスして、約2時間の机上演習を行います。参加者は役割に応じて、提供される状況の情報を元に、発生したインシデントへの対処指示や社内外の関係者への情報連携など、適切な対応を選んでシナリオを進めていきます。普段とは異なる有事の連携・対応を仮想的に経験することで、実際のインシデント発生時の的確な対応につなげることができます。演習終了後には参加者各自の取り組みの結果と評価が提示され、対応の課題や改善点を理解できます。 ２．メタバースにより、臨場感のある演習が可能に 部門横断型のサイバーセキュリティ演習はこれまで、会場の準備や参加者の調整などに時間がかかっていましたが、本演習は、遠隔地からでも参加できます。また、「周囲のメンバーの回答を見て、自身の取るべき行動が推察できてしまう」という、従来の集合型演習の課題も解消できます。メタバースでの臨場感があるインシデント対応体験が可能となり、さらに参加者間で振り返りを行うことによって、自社のインシデント対応計画策定時のベースとなる共通認識を得ることができます。 ３．サイバーセキュリティの第一人者・名和利男氏が監修 本演習のシナリオは、CSIRT構築やサイバー演習、法的証拠となるデジタル情報の回収・分析等を行うフォレンジックの国内第一人者であり、数多くのインシデント対応で実績がある名和利男氏（サイバーディフェンス研究所専務理事 上級分析官）の知見を反映しています。 ■本演習を監修した名和利男氏からのコメント 昨今のビジネス環境において、労働力人口の減少、消費者ニーズの多様化の影響などから、デジタル化やクラウドサービスの利用が急速に進んでいます。これによりサイバー攻撃のきっかけとなりうる領域が拡大しています。しかし、私たちはそのリスクに気づかず、突然発生するサイバー攻撃に困惑して被害をいたずらに拡大させています。本トレーニングが企業と顧客を守るための模擬経験として活用され、サイバー攻撃への組織的対処能力の向上と被害軽減につながるものと期待しています。 【価格（税込）】 55万円／回 （4名一組での受講） 【今後の展開】 DNPは、広範なサプライチェーンに関わる製造業のほか、多様な企業・団体に「組織連携コース_メタバース演習」を提供していきます。また、サイバーナレッジアカデミーが提供するセキュリティ担当者向け演習等と組み合わせることで、企業の多様なセキュリティ人材の育成を支援していきます。 ＊2　ロールプレイング型メタバース構築サービスについて

"767",":Article","2023年9月28日 マンガ制作をAIで効率化して、カラー化＝“着彩”の時間を2分の1に マンガ多言語制作システム「MOES」に着彩機能を実装し、マンガの海外展開を支援 製品・サービス 出版・電子出版・教育 AI DX コンテンツビジネス 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、多言語対応のマンガ制作ツール「DNPマンガオンラインエディトリアルシステム MOES®（モエス）＊1」に、株式会社10ANTZ＜テンアンツ＞＊2が開発した「マンガAI着彩機能」を搭載し、2023年10月にトライアル運用を開始します。 MOESは、マンガ等のコンテンツの創出・制作・各種データ変換を一貫して支援するスタジオ「MANGA CREATIVE WORKS®」＊3で提供する制作ツールです。この機能により、従来は手作業で行っていたマンガに色を付ける“着彩”の工程を大幅に効率化します。 また、オノマトペ（マンガに描かれる画像化された擬音語・擬態語）を削除するとともに、削除後の部分にあるはずの背景を推定して描く機能もMOESに実装します。このように、翻訳以外の機能も今後MOESに集約することでマンガ制作の効率化をさらに推進し、マンガコンテンツのグローバル展開に貢献していきます。 ＡＩ着彩例 開発背景 近年、世界的にスマートフォン用アプリやWebサイトでマンガを楽しむ読者が増加する中、日本のマンガコンテンツは人気作品が翻訳され、海外展開されていますが、現在、多言語版の制作負荷やグローバルな流通の課題によって、海外に展開できていないタイトルが多数あります。マンガは人物・キャラクターのほか背景・吹き出し・セリフ・オノマトペ等の構成要素が多く、特にカラー化する着彩の工程は非常に難易度が高いため、現状ではそのほとんどを手作業で行っており、制作に時間がかかることが課題となっていました。 こうした課題に対してDNPは、「MANGA CREATIVE WORKS®」を構築し、そのなかで、マンガの多言語版制作に向けてMOESを展開しています。今回、AI（人工知能）を活用して着彩する機能をMOESに搭載することで、マンガコンテンツの着彩工程の生産性向上と効率化を支援します。DNPは引き続き、社外のパートナーとの連携も強化して、出版市場の活性化に向けたサービスを推進していきます。 MANGA　CREATIVE　WORKSにおけるMOESの提供機能一覧 MOESによるマンガ制作のシステム化とAI着彩機能について DNPが2016年からサービス提供しているMOESは、多くの言語への翻訳版のマンガ制作に必要な翻訳・レタリング・校正・進捗管理等を行うクラウド型のシステムです。このサービスにマンガ制作をさらに効率化する機能を集約していく計画であり、今回その第一弾として、AIを活用した着彩機能を実装しました。 「マンガAI着彩機能」では、表現上の効果について、模様や色の濃さなどを影やグラデーションに置き換えて着彩することが可能です。電子書籍で配信するマンガコンテンツを制作する場合、全てを手作業で着彩する場合と比較して、修正も含めて生産性が2倍以上（作業時間が2分の1以下に短縮）となりました（自社での実証実験結果による）。 セリフ等が無いため翻訳が不要なWeb素材やグッズ制作の場合、着彩機能だけを利用することができます。今後追加を予定している各種機能についても、制作者が必要な機能のみ選択して利用できるようにしていきます。 また、オノマトペを削除するとともに、削除後の部分にあるはずの背景を推定して描く機能もMOESに実装します。従来、元の言語のオノマトペの画像を残して、その近くに翻訳を併記する場合が多かったのに対して、この機能でオノマトペを削除することで、より読みやすい表現を容易に行えるようになります。 今後、複数の多言語版を同時に（simultaneous）制作する“サイマル対応”など、翻訳関連の機能を順次追加・改善して提供していきます。 オノマトペ（擬音語・擬態語）削除例 今後の展開 2023年12月に、MOESでの「マンガAI着彩機能」の本格運用を開始し、出版社・企業・教育機関等に提供していきます。DNPは引き続き10ANTZと連携し、着彩の品質向上や機能改善を進めるとともに、マンガ制作の一層の効率化に向けて、一貫したシステムの構築を強化していきます。 また、多言語版のマンガ制作について、高い品質を確保しながら、作業の負荷とコストを低減する機能の開発・提供をさらに進めて、出版社等のコンテンツホルダーによる海外へのマンガコンテンツ展開を支援します。プリントオンデマンドや電子配信など多様なコンテンツ提供の形にも対応し、コミック市場の拡大に応える体制を構築して、出版業界の継続的な発展に貢献していきます。 DNPは、本システムをはじめとする国内外のマンガ制作関連事業で、2028年までに累計150億円の売上を目指します。 ＊1　特許取得済（JP.PAT.5605004）

"768",":Article","2023年9月27日 京都市で開催される現代アートの祭典「ニュイ・ブランシュKYOTO 2023」に協賛 女性の権利を訴えるポスターを通じて「D&I（多様性と包摂）」の推進に貢献 イベント コラボレーション 地域創生・まちづくり デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、2023年9月30日（土）～10月28日（土）に京都市内の32か所で開催される、現代アートを楽しむ祭典「ニュイ・ブランシュ（Nuit Blanche：白夜祭）KYOTO 2023」（主催：京都市、関西日仏学館）に協賛します。  DNPは、「ダイバーシティ&インクルージョン（D&I：多様性と包摂）」を重要な経営課題の一つとして推進しています。女性社員の活躍についても20年以上にわたって推進しており、今回、「ニュイ・ブランシュKYOTO 2023」のメインプログラムの一つ「女性の権利を訴えるポスター展」（主催：関西日仏学館）の趣旨に賛同して協賛します。会場の一つである四条通東洞院地下道に展示する世界の約30名のグラフィックデザイナーの作品について印刷協力しています。DNPはアートの力を活かすことで、多様な価値観を人々が認め合う社会、想像力が豊かで創造的な人々で溢れる社会の形成に寄与していきます。 「ニュイ・ブランシュKYOTO 2023」告知ポスター（左）、プログラムに掲載されている地下道の作品（右） 【「ニュイ・ブランシュKYOTO 2023」について】 ○開催日 ： 2023年9月30日（土） ～10月28日（土）  ○会場 ： 京都駅ビル駅前広場、関西日仏学館など、京都市内の32カ所  ○内容 ： 京都市の姉妹都市・パリ（フランス）では、夜通し現代アートを楽しめる祭典「ニュイ・ブランシュ（白夜祭）」を毎年開催しています。これに着想を得た京都市は、在京都フランス総領事館の後援で、現代アートの祭典「ニュイ・ブランシュKYOTO」を2011年から開催しています。13回目の今年のテーマは「パワー（PUISSANCES）」であり、自然のパワー、テクノロジーのパワー、人間のパワーなど、各会場でテーマに沿ったアートイベントが約1か月にわたって開催されます。  〇WebサイトURL 【「女性の権利を訴えるポスター展」の企画について】  「Woman Life Freedom（女性、命、自由）」をスローガンに、この普遍的とも言える闘いに対するビジョンを表明する形で、世界中のグラフィックデザイナーが制作したポスターから、パリ市立近代美術館で展示された28作品をセレクトしました。今回、Webサイトでの公開に続いて、「ニュイ・ブランシュKYOTO 2023」が開催されるリアルな公共の場で、これらの作品を体験することができます。展示会場は、地下鉄烏丸線 四条駅・阪急電鉄 烏丸駅の19番出口付近です。  今回展示する世界のグラフィックデザイナーによる28点のポスター 【DNPグループの「D&I」の取り組みについて】  「DNPグループ行動規範」に「人類の尊厳と多様性の尊重」を掲げ、「人権方針」を定めているDNPは、事業を通じて、多様な社会で暮らす多様な人々に対する最適な価値の提供に注力しています。その実現に向けて、積極的に「ダイバーシティ＆インクルージョン（多様性と包摂：D&I）」を推進し、多様な個を活かすことが“あたりまえ”となる状態を目指しています。社員の一人ひとりは多様な強みを持つ“ダイバーシティの一員”であり、そうした強みを“包摂”して掛け合わせることがDNPの価値創出の源泉となります。特に意思決定の多様性を高めるため、女性の活躍・登用にも力を入れており、既存の環境に適応させるのではなく、公平な機会の提供などによって、女性の能力を最大に活かすように努めています。DNPは今回の協賛を通じて、社内だけでなく社外とのコミュニケーションを積極的に行い、女性をはじめとする多様な人々が活躍できる企業風土や社会の実現につなげていきます。

"769",":Article","2023年9月25日 ツヤのないマットな質感で指紋がつきにくい内装用化粧シートを開発 欧米等のインテリア業界のトレンドに合う“質感”と、独自のEB技術による“環境対応”を両立 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 生活空間 デザイン 環境 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：北島義斉　以下：DNP）は、マット（低艶）な質感で意匠性が高く、指紋がつきにくい内装用化粧シート「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ® プレミア」を2024年1月に発売します。本製品は、住宅および非住宅の室内建具（ドア・引き戸）・収納・内装部材（造作材等）として高い支持を得ている「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ」＊1シリーズの上級グレード品で、2023年7月発表の「（同）フロア プレミア」＊2に次ぐ第二弾です。 DNPは、基材に塗った各種材料を電子線（Electron Beam）の照射で硬化させ、多様な機能を持たせる独自のEBコーティング＊3技術で、長年にわたり市場から高い評価を得ています。この技術を進化させ、人々が暮らすあらゆる空間の価値を向上させる「空間ソリューション」の一環で、室内用の製品として、地球環境にも配慮した“人と環境にやさしい”高質感内装化粧シートを開発・提供していきます。 DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ プレミア サフマーレ プレミアを使用した空間イメージ 【内装用化粧シート「サフマーレ プレミア」開発の背景】 近年、コロナ禍をきっかけの一つとして、テレワークなどの新しい働き方・暮らし方が定着し、家で過ごす時間が増えるなか、より“安らぎ”や“落ち着き”がある住宅・インテリア空間へのニーズが高まっています。また、欧米を中心に、光の反射を抑えたマット（低艶）な内装材を使った落ち着いた空間やインテリアデザインがトレンドとなっており、フローリングや建具等の化粧シートの一貫性を持たせたデザイン設計が求められています。 こうしたニーズに対してDNPは今回、マット（低艶）な質感と、指紋がつきにくい機能を備え、繊細な曲面加工も可能な内装用化粧シート「DNP EBオレフィンシート　サフマーレ プレミア」を開発しました。 【内装用化粧シート「サフマーレ プレミア」の特長】 １．新たなコーティング技術で従来は困難だったマット（低艶）な質感を実現 DNPは、木目柄などを印刷した上で、新たに開発した特殊コーティングを施すことにより、従来オレフィン系樹脂フィルムでは表現が困難だったマット（低艶）な質感と滑らかな触感の意匠を実現しました。この新製品によって、欧米を中心にインテリア業界のトレンドとなっている光の反射が少ないマットなデザインにも対応できるようになりました。 ２．表面に微細な凹凸をつけるDNP独自の技術により指紋のつきにくさを向上 オレフィン系樹脂フィルムの表面に微細な凹凸をつけるDNP独自の技術により、指との接触面積を減らすことで、従来製品と比較して指紋がつきにくい機能を実現しました。特に濃い単色や木目柄の扉などで指紋が目立ちやすいという状況に対して、効果を発揮します。 指紋のつきにくい機能の比較。サフマーレ プレミア（左）と従来製品（右） ３．建具（ドア・引き戸）や収納等の高い意匠ニーズにも対応 高意匠な質感を持つ化粧シートとして、室内建具や収納等のデザインの幅を広げるとともに、繊細な曲面のラッピング加工にも対応できます。 ４．製造時の有害物質の拡散を防ぎ、温室効果ガスの排出量を削減 DNP独自のEBコーティングを活用した「サフマーレ」シリーズの製造は、建具や収納等に直接塗装する方法と比べて、空気中への有害物質の拡散が少ないため、安全・安心な環境で作業ができます。また、EBコーティングでは電子線硬化型インキを使用しており、熱硬化型インキで製造する場合と比べ、温室効果ガス（GHG）の排出量を約15%、揮発性有機化合物（VOC）排出量を約30%低減できます＊4。 【今後の展開】 DNPは「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ プレミア」を集合住宅や一戸建て住宅等向けに、ハウスメーカーや建材メーカー等に販売し、2026年度までに累計約5億円の売上を目指します。 なお、本製品は、DNP社員を窓口として、社外のパートナーにご利用いただいているプレゼンテーションとコラボレーション用の施設「P&Iラボ・東京」に展示しています。 ＊1　サフマーレ（Safmalle） ： SAFE（安全な・危険がない）とMALLEABILITY（適応性・順応性）という言葉を組み合わせたDNPの建材用オレフィンシートの総称。「環境･健康配慮」を意味する造語。DNPは、焼却しても有害なガスがほとんど発生しない環境配慮材料のオレフィンの活用や、シックハウス症候群の原因とされる化学物質の不使用など、環境や健康に配慮した製品開発を推進しています。また、EBコーティング用の複数の樹脂を用途に合わせて最適なバランスで設計して機能を付与することで、MALLEABILITYを実現しています。

塗工した樹脂を電子線の照射で硬化させる技術。ウレタンやUV樹脂をコーティングした製品に比べ、傷・汚れ・日光等に強く、高い耐久性と実用性能、品質安定性を確保できます。製造工程での省エネルギー化やCO2排出量削減、無溶剤塗工も可能な次世代型の環境対応技術です。 ＊4　DNPの製造工程で、熱硬化型インキとEB硬化型インキの同一量を塗工した場合のシミュレーション。

大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、2023年7月26日（水）に採択された、警視庁サイバーセキュリティ対策本部による「メタバースを利用した訓練実施委託」＊1を受け、「警視庁サイバーセキュリティセンター」を2023年9月25日（月）にオープンします。 本センターは、サイバーセキュリティに関する生活者の知識を高め、脅威への対処能力向上を目指す目的で開発されたもので、DNPが株式会社AKIBA観光協議会とともに運営するメタバース「バーチャル秋葉原」内に設置しました。 ＊バーチャル秋葉原について → https://www.virtual-akihabara.com/ バーチャル空間での「警視庁サイバーセキュリティセンター」のイメージ DNPは2021年から、XR（Extended Reality）技術によってリアルとバーチャルの空間を融合して人々の体験価値を高める「XRコミュニケーション®」の事業を展開しています。本センターの利用者は、時間・場所を問わずいつでも、自身の理解度や目的に応じたサイバーセキュリティに関する学習を進めることができます。本センターを通じて、DNPは警視庁とサイバーセキュリティの認知啓発をおこなうとともに、生活者が犯罪に巻き込まれるリスクの低減や、より安全・安心な社会の発展に貢献していきます。 【「警視庁サイバーセキュリティセンター」の特長】 １．幅広い世代に向けた多様な学習コンテンツを公開 本センターでは、2022年7月26日（火）締結の「サイバーセキュリティ人材の育成に関する産学官連携についての協定」＊2に参画している警視庁とDNP、中央大学の強みを活かした学習コンテンツを提供します。また、これらは内容やその難易度に応じて1階と2階のフロアに分けて配置されており、利用者は自身の理解度や目的に合わせた学習を進めることができます。 ２．サイバーセキュリティをより理解しやすい学習環境 本センターでは、インターネット上でのコミュニケーションの留意点や、著作物の取り扱いなど、日々の生活で活用できるサイバーセキュリティ対策について学べます。また、学んだことをバーチャル空間での体験や交流に活かすことで、サイバーセキュリティ対策を実践でき、より深い理解や学びの促進にもつながります。 ３．「バーチャル秋葉原」と連動し、新たなコンテンツ企画も開催 バーチャル秋葉原内にはカプセルトイが設置されており、本センターを訪れる利用者は各所にある仮想コインを集めて遊ぶことができます。今回、カプセルトイの新たなグッズとしてパトカー等の画像を用意し、今後も新たな種類の画像追加を検討していきます。また、本センターへ向かう途中にあるウォッチパーティ会場ではバーチャルアイドルの動画視聴ができ、訪れるさまざまな利用者に楽しんでいただけます。 カプセルトイの画像イメージ ウォッチパーティ会場の様子 【今後の展開】 DNPは今後も警視庁と連携し、「警視庁サイバーセキュリティセンター」のコンテンツ拡充や、サイバーセキュリティの認知啓蒙に貢献していきます。また、教育分野におけるバーチャル空間の活用についても検証を続けて、具体的なサービスの提供などにつなげていきます。 ■「バーチャル秋葉原」の推奨動作環境 ：

"771",":Article","2023年9月22日 ラベル製品の資源循環に取り組む「J-ECOL」に参画 循環型社会を目指してラベル製品の使用済み剥離紙をリサイクル 製品・サービス 印刷・加工 サステナビリティ 環境 環境 ESG コラボレーション 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）グループの株式会社DNPデータテクノは2023年8月に、シールやラベル等の使用済み剥離紙の資源循環を普及・促進する一般社団法人ラベル循環協会（J-ECOL：Japan-Earth Conscious Labeling Association）＊1に加盟しました。 シールやラベル等は、各種製品等の“モノ”に“情報”を加える手段の一つとして、人々の生活や企業等の事業活動で重要な役割を果たしています。一方、環境負荷の面では、粘着部分を保護する用紙（剥離紙）はシールやラベルの使用後に不要となります。また、剝がしやすくする材料が塗られているため、現状では製紙原料として使いにくく、その多くが再生資源として有効利用できていない状況です。DNPはJ-ECOLへの加盟等を通じて、循環型経済への移行に向けて、資源としての有効活用につながる、より安価で便利なシール・ラベルの展開などを推進し、環境負荷低減に貢献していきます。 J-ECOLの概要と主な活動内容 製品のバリューチェーン（原材料調達・製造・販売・使用・廃棄・回収等）に関わる全ての企業が一体となった資源循環モデルの構築に向けて、企業の枠を越えて取り組みます。例えば、使用済み剥離紙の提供企業をエンドユーザーとして、リサイクル企業との仲介を行うことで資源循環を支援します。また、複数の分科会活動も推進します。普及分科会で、加盟企業とともに剥離紙の資源化を進めるとともに、技術分科会で、再生しやすい剥離紙の検討、剥離紙から取り出す再生パルプの活用提案、使用済み剥離紙から再び剥離紙をつくる水平リサイクルの検討などを行います。 剥離紙　資源循環図 ＜主な活動内容＞ （1）使用済み剥離紙の再生資源化の普及・促進 ・分別ガイドラインの策定 ・会員企業による分別周知活動 ・使用済み剥離紙リサイクルの相談受付 ・リサイクル企業とラベルユーザー企業のマッチング　など （2）リサイクル技術の確立支援 ・再生しやすい剥離紙の設計、再生を促すための補助　など （3）リサイクル状況の可視化・情報発信 ・シールやラベル等に関する環境負荷の可視化 ・普及・促進活動の進捗等に関する情報発信　など 環境負荷の低減等に向けたDNPの取り組みについて DNPは常に事業活動と地球環境の共生を考え、環境問題への対応を重要な経営課題の一つに位置付けています。2020年3月には「DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050」を策定し、「脱炭素社会」「循環型社会」「自然共生社会」の実現に向けた取り組みを加速させています。その一環としてDNPは、CO2の排出量を抑えた環境配慮型の「ラベル伝票」＊2 を開発し、2023年8月に発表しています。DNPは引き続き、持続可能なより良い社会、より心豊かな暮らしの実現に向けて、環境負荷の低減に向けた活動を推進していきます。 ＊1　一般社団法人ラベル循環協会（J-ECOL）WebサイトURL → https://www.j-ecol.or.jp/ 　　　会員一覧 → https://www.j-ecol.or.jp/aboutus

"773",":Article","2023年9月21日 間接材購買システムの導入で業務効率化とコスト削減を実現 間接材発注の作業工数を約10分の1に削減 ニュースリリース 企業情報 DX 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：北島義斉　以下：DNP）は、事務用品や消耗品等の間接材を対象とした新しい購買システム ＊を2023年6月に導入しました。グループ会社の39社にも同システムを導入し、同年9月には導入の効果検証を行いました。これにより、間接材発注作業に関する工数・リードタイム・コストの削減を実現し、DNP社員や取引先社員の働き方の改革やガバナンスの強化につなげています。 なお、この取り組みは、KPMGコンサルティング株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長 兼CEO：宮原正弘）の支援のもとで実施しています。 ＊　新しい購買システムとして導入したAlpha Purchase社のSaaS型システムについて→ https://www.alphapurchase.co.jp/mro/index.html     システム利用シーン(左)とシステム利用画面(右)のイメージ 新システム導入の背景 DNPは、複数の社内システムのDX(デジタルトランスフォーメーション)化を進め、DNPグループ内と協力会社の業務効率化やテレワークの推進、ガバナンス強化などに取り組んでいます。これらの取り組みの一環として今回、各種間接材の発注業務（商品検索・見積・承認・発注・検収等）を対象とした新たなシステムを導入し、購買部門のDXをさらに強化しました。 DNPの購買部門では、資材発注の際にこれまで、複写式の紙伝票やFAXの使用などに多くの時間・負荷がかかっていました。また、比較的高額な生産用資材から、製造に直接使用しない事務用品等の間接材まで同じ業務フローで発注していたため、特に件数の多い間接材の発注業務で負荷が高くなっていました。 新システムの主な特長と効果 リードタイムの短縮：物品等の発注権限を持つ各部門の担当者は、ガバナンスを確保したシステム上において、購買部門を通さず直接発注できるようになりました。また、伝票による受入検収作業を自動化し、システム導入前に比べて、間接材発注1件あたりの作業工数を最少で約10分の1に、納品のリードタイムを最短で約５分の１にすることができました。 発注価格の最適化と、増加する品目数への対応：既存のサプライヤーに加え、Amazon等のECサイトとも幅広く連携し、複数の商品を一括で検索して間接材を発注することができます。既存か新規かに関わらず多くのサプライヤーに対してオープンな自由競争の環境をつくるとともに、発注価格の最適化を図ります。また、新システムの導入により、発注できる間接材の品目数が約4,000万以上に拡大しました（ECサイトを除く）。 ガバナンスの強化：領収書処理による事後精算の件数を削減するとともに、購買情報の一元管理によって、発注の適正化や不正モニタリングなどを強化しています。また、紙の伝票に基づく手入力作業を削減し、単価登録間違い・計上漏れなどのミスの削減につなげています。 購買部門の業務改革推進：本システムの導入は、ペーパーレス化や働き方改革の実現にもつながりました。間接材に関しては、発注業務自体の負荷低減に加え、蓄積された購買情報を分析することで、関連する業務プロセス全体の最適化にもつなげていきます。また、地球環境や人権への配慮、安定調達の実現に向けた取り組み、経営へのインパクトがより高い生産資材の調達、新規開発材料の提案といった付加価値の高い業務にも注力していきます。

"777",":Article","2023年9月11日 金属対応RFIDによるDX化で作業時間を20％削減 軽仮設機材レンタル業アクトワンヤマイチの業務効率化を実現 製品・サービス 認証・セキュリティ BPO・業務効率化 DX 認証・セキュリティ データ流通 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、金属製品に取り付けても高い読み取り精度を実現する“金属対応RFID（Radio Frequency Identification：電子タグ）”を利用した機材管理システムを開発・提供しており、今回、建設用軽仮設機材のレンタルを専門に行う株式会社アクトワンヤマイチに導入しました。5か月の試用期間では、入出庫・検収作業時間を従来と比べて約20％短縮しました。 なおDNPは、2023年9月13日（水）～15日（金）に東京ビッグサイトで開催される「国際物流総合展2023」＊1のBIPROGY株式会社のブースにて、「金属対応RFIDを利用した機材管理システム」とその導入事例を紹介します。 「金属対応RFIDを利用した機材管理システム」導入の背景 アクトワンヤマイチはこれまで、軽仮設機材のレンタル業務に関わる入出庫・検収・棚卸し等の作業を主に紙帳票で管理していました。2025年の大阪・関西万博などで国内の建設需要の増加が見込まれる中、同社はデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）による業務効率化等に取り組み、「業務の標準化」→「ペーパーレス化」→「RFIDを使った効率化」とステップを踏んだ計画の立案と実施に注力しています。 2019年にはDNPがタブレット端末用アプリを提供し、「業務の標準化」と「ペーパーレス化」をスタートしました。2021年には「DNP RFID導入検証支援サービス」＊2を活用し、数メートル離れても複数のIDを読み取れる「RFIDを使った効率化」の検討を進めてきました。こうした取り組みの検証結果を受けて、今回、「金属対応RFIDを利用した機材管理システム」が同社の業務効率化に有効であるとの判断から、導入に至りました。 「金属対応RFIDを利用した機材管理システム」の特長 ○耐久性のある金属対応RFIDを利用した一括読み取りによる業務効率化 ・ 本システムは、UHF帯の金属対応RFIDと通信機器、管理システムで構成されます。RFIDは一般的に、金属に取り付けると通信距離が短くなりますが、足場やはしごなどの軽仮設機材に適用できる金属対応RFIDを選定することで、複数のRFIDの一括読み取りを可能にしました。 ・ また、建築現場や高圧洗浄工程などの過酷な環境における高い耐久性も備えています。 ・ RFIDに製品コード等をレーザーで印字し、スマートフォンのアプリで撮影することで、機材管理システムと連携することもできます。 ○システム導入による業務効率化 ・ 従来、紙帳票で行っていた目視確認や手書き入力などのアナログ業務をペーパーレス化することで、作業時間の短縮やミスの低減、作業手順のバラつきの解消などにつなげていきます。 ・ 従来の業務の流れを大幅に変えることなく、運用現場に則した操作性を実現しました。 システムの管理画面（左）とタブレット端末画面（右）のイメージ アクトワンヤマイチ　執行役員 兼 機材管理部長　岡田 正志様のコメント 岡田正志 執行役員 「社内の生産性向上の取り組みと、お客様における利便性を検討する中でRFIDの導入を決定いたしました。また、物流業界の2024年問題に関係して当社として待ち時間の解消が、新たに提供できるサービスであると考え、今後もお客様へ貢献していきたいと考えております。」 今後の展開 DNPは引き続き、「金属対応RFIDを利用した機材管理システム」や「DNP RFID導入検証支援サービス」などを通じて、多様な業種・業態のDX化・業務効率化を支援していきます。特に、機材レンタルや建設業界を中心に販売を強化し、2025年度までに累計5億円の売上を目指します。 ＊1　国際物流総合展2023について → https://www.logis-tech-tokyo.gr.jp/ie/index.html ＊2　DNP RFID導入検証支援サービスについて →

Bhd.）は、2023年9月13日（水）～16日（土）にバングラデシュ人民共和国で開催されるテキスタイル（織物や繊維等）の国際的な見本市「22nd Textech Bangladesh 2023 International Expo」に初出展します。DNPブースでは、衣類用の洗濯表示タグや商品タグ、製造工場内で商品管理タグ等の印字に使う熱転写プリンター用インクリボン等を展示して、世界からの来場者に、DNPが提供する高品質な製品を訴求します。 DNPの主な出展内容と各製品の特長 １．布に印字できる高耐久インクリボン 布への印字に適した、洗濯・ドライクリーニング耐性があるレジンリボン＊1で、ナイロンやサテン生地等にも使える汎用性も備えています。また、世界最高水準の安全レベルで、繊維関連の素材や製品に有害な化学物質が含まれていないことを証明する認証規格「OEKO-TEX standard 100」を取得しています。 印字のイメージ ２．偽造防止用インクリボン 紫外線（UV）照明に当たると蛍光を発するUVレジンを使ったインクリボンです。印字された情報は通常照明では肉眼で視認しにくいため、偽造防止などのセキュリティー用途に展開できます。 通常照明下（左） →　UV照明下でロゴなどが浮かび上がるイメージ（右） ３．RFID埋め込みタグ RFID（Radio-Frequency

大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、2023年8月8日（火）～29日（火）に、社員の家族による職場参観「ファミリーフレンドリーデー」（FFD）を日本全国の9拠点で実施しました。 DNPはFFDを通じて、次世代を担う子どもたちの仕事への興味や働きたい気持ち（就業意欲）などを育んでいます。また、社員と家族のコミュニケーションを促進し、ワーク・ライフバランスについて考える機会とすることで、社員のモチベーションの向上や組織の活性化につなげています。 DNPはこれからも常に社員と家族を大切にして、社会や生活者の多様な変化に対応し、また変化を先取りしながら、FFDをはじめとした多様なコミュニケーション施策を展開していきます。 市谷地区で参加した社員・大友香さん（DNP情報システム）による「ファミリーフレンドリーデー」のイラストレポート 東京・市谷地区での実施内容 ○　本社がある東京都新宿区の市谷地区の拠点では2023年8月8日（火）に実施し、22の事業部門・グループ会社が参加しました。DNPグループの歩みや事業の説明に加え、社外のパートナーと社員のプレゼンテーション＆コラボレーションを活発に行うための施設「P&Iラボ・東京」（DNP市谷加賀町第3ビル）の見学を行いました。 ○　製品・サービスの展示・体験を通じて、人々が日常生活で触れる多くのものに、DNPが多様な価値を開発・提供していることを紹介しました。例えば、ヘッドマウントディスプレーを装着し、VR空間内を動き回ってアート作品等を鑑賞できるシステム「みどころウォーク」などの体験も行いました。 ○　事前に子どもたちが好きな色や文字を選び、作成したオリジナル名刺を当日、子どもたちに渡し、職場訪問の際に、親である社員の上司や同僚と名刺交換するプログラムを実施しました。 ○　「未来にあったら良いと思うこと」をシェアするアイデアシートを用意して、本イベントを通して生まれたアイデア等を書いて貼るワークショップを行いました。 。 ■参加者の声 参加した子どもたちから、「お父さんの勤める会社が楽しそうだった」「名刺交換は緊張したが、楽しかった」「未来について考えている会社だということが分かった」「普段の生活で目にしているものが、実はDNPでつくられていることが分かった」などの声が集まりました。 参加した社員へのアンケートでは、「参加して仕事へのモチベーションや家族との時間などに前向きな意識変化があったか」という質問に対して、98％の社員が「はい」と回答しました。 各拠点での実施概要 DNPの全国9拠点でFFDを実施し、ご家族と社員を合わせて426名が参加しました（東京：市谷地区187名、埼玉：蕨地区16名・北戸田地区12名・狭山地区55名、茨城：牛久地区33名、福島：泉崎地区55名、奈良地区26名、岡山地区20名、広島地区22名）。

"781",":Article","2023年9月7日 DNP本社ビル内のコンビニで顔認証決済の実証実験を開始 小売・サービス業界の非対面決済や無人化・省人化を支援 製品・サービス 認証・セキュリティ 決済・EC DX 認証・セキュリティ 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、本社がある東京・市谷地区のDNP市谷加賀町第3ビル内の「ナチュラルローソンDNP加賀町アトリウム店＊」で、2023年9月4日（月）～11月30日（木）に、顔認証を活用した決済サービスの実証実験を行います。 DNPが提供する新しい認証サービスの一つである顔認証決済に関して、小売業界やサービス業界における有用性と利用者の受容性などを評価・検証します。 ＊DNPの従業員専用の店舗です。 顔認証決済の実証実験の背景 店舗での販売員等の人手不足や、コロナ禍でクローズアップされた感染防止の観点などから、生活者自身が決済するセルフレジや無人店舗のニーズが高まっています。一方で、現状のセルフレジ等の仕組みでは、年齢制限などがある特定の商品を販売する際に対象者を確認できないといった課題がありました。 こうした課題の解決に向けてDNPは、自身の顔写真を一度登録するだけで複数のサービスを利用できる認証の仕組みや、本人確認・年齢確認の機能を持つ顔認証決済サービスの検討を進めています。その取り組みの一環として今回、小売店への導入に向けた実証実験を行います。DNPは本サービスを促進することで、小売業・サービス業の店舗での非対面決済と無人化・省人化の実現に貢献します。 顔認証決済の実証実験のポイント ○　利用の手順は以下の通りです。 社員は、専用の登録アプリで事前に顔写真を撮影・登録します。 対象のコンビニエンスストアのレジに導入した顔認証対応の端末を用いて商品を購入できます。 料金の支払いは社員証決済と連動しており、社員証決済が可能なDNPグループ社員は、誰でも利用することができます。 ○　顔の特徴をもとに個人の判別を行って認証します。決済時に、カードや現金、スマートフォン用アプリなどは不要です。また、パスワード入力などの動作も必要ないため、利用者がパスワードを忘れたり入力を間違えたりすることもありません。 ○　DNPが長年培ってきた個人情報管理のノウハウを活かし、高いセキュリティ環境を構築することで、利用者は安心して決済を行うことができます。 DNPの顔認証決済サービスの特長 １．総合的なサービス構築 顔写真を登録するWebサイトの構築、顔写真を含む個人情報の保管、顔認証アプリの開発、店頭什器の制作など、顔写真データの登録から利用・保管まで一貫して行います。また、システムのデザインや店舗内の空間デザインなど、リアルとデジタルを掛け合わせた総合的なユーザーインターフェースの提供を行います。 ２．使いやすいアプリでの顔写真登録とシングルサインオンでの本人認証 DNPは、生活者が利用する口座開設アプリや本人認証アプリなど、多様なアプリの開発・運用の実績を持っており、生活者がアプリを利用する際の最初のハードルとなる情報登録に関する課題の分析も進めています。今回、そうしたノウハウを活かして、利用者ができるだけ簡潔かつ直観的に顔認証決済を行えるようにアプリを設計しています。また、社員情報を使ったシングルサインオンによってスムーズに本人認証を行うとともに、支払い方法を社員証決済に連動することで、安全・安心かつシームレスな顔認証決済を実現しました。 ３．システムおよび店舗での導入・運用負荷軽減 DNPの社員証決済と連動することで、顔認証のシステム開発を効率化し、短期間での店舗導入フローを構築しました。また、店舗スタッフの作業やマニュアルの追加などが発生しないよう運用負荷を軽減し、システム運用リスクも最小限に抑えました。  今後の展開 DNPは本実証実験の成果をもとに、高度なセキュリティかつ利便性の高い顔認証サービスの開発を進めていきます。小売業やサービス業の無人店舗・省人化店舗の効率的な運営の実現に向けて、顔認証決済の有用性を評価・分析するなど、店舗での顔認証サービスの導入に向けた効果と課題を把握し、生活者の買い物体験価値の向上に貢献します。 また、DNPが提供するBPOサービスやICカード等と顔認証決済を組み合わせることで、事業会社や生活者にとって「快適で安心な毎日をあたりまえにする」認証サービスを展開していきます。 ■参考：DNPの「認証DX®」の取り組みについて DNPは、本人確認や本人認証が必要な場面で、最適な認証の仕組みを組み合わせ、セキュアで使いやすいサービスを総合的に提供する「認証DX」を推進しています。安全・安心かつスピーディーな本人確認・本人認証を実現する「認証DX」を通じて、リアルとデジタルをシームレスにつなげ、生活者の体験価値を向上させていきます。

"782",":Article","2023年9月6日 第6回エコプロアワードで「奨励賞」を受賞 独自のCO₂算定サービスによる企業のカーボンニュートラル推進支援が評価 サステナビリティ 社会からの評価 環境 製品・サービス 生活用品向けパッケージ 食品・飲料向けパッケージ ヘルスケア・ライフサイエンス 環境 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム CO₂算定サービス＊1によるカーボンニュートラルの取組み支援」で、一般社団法人サステナブル経営推進機構（SuMPO）が主催する「第6回エコプロアワード」（後援：財務省、農林水産省、経済産業省、国土交通省、環境省、金融庁）の「奨励賞」を受賞しました。 ＊1　「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム CO₂算定サービス」について →  https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/10162993_1567.html https://www.dnp.co.jp/media/detail/20168289_1563.html 「エコプロアワード」は、日本市場において事業者、消費者、投資家、市場関係者に評価が高く、具体的に優れた環境配慮が組み込まれた製品、サービス、技術、ソリューション、ビジネスモデルを表彰することにより、これらのさらなる開発・普及の促進を図り、サステナビリティトランスフォーメーション（SX）の実現に寄与することを目的に表彰するものです（同賞の募集要項から抜粋）。 今回、「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム」を活用した取り組みが、パッケージの原材料調達や製造といったサプライチェーン上流でのCO₂排出量把握に関する課題を解決し、カーボンニュートラル実現に向けた情報・コミュニケーションの基盤を提供する先進的な取り組みとして評価されました。 今回受賞した「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム」の概要 本システムは、パッケージの原材料調達から製造・廃棄までのライフサイクル全体で、CO₂排出量を可視化するとともに、SuMPOによる「SuMPO／第三者認証型カーボンフットプリント包括算定制度」の承認を得るものです。このシステムによって、DNPはステークホルダーに対して、公平性・信頼性の高い算定結果を迅速に提供することが可能となります。 企業などが設定するCO₂削減目標に対して、パッケージが占める割合や、環境配慮パッケージを使用した場合の削減度合いなどの把握が可能となります。 今後の展開 DNPは引き続き、「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム」の算定対象を拡充していきます。また、製品・サービスのライフサイクル全体での環境負荷を定量的に評価するライフサイクルアセスメントの手法を活用した環境負荷改善シナリオの提案や、目標に対する効果測定等のコンサルティングサービスなどにも取り組み、幅広い業界に対してカーボンニュートラルの取り組みを支援していきます。 ■参考 ： CO₂排出量データの可視化に関するDNPの取り組み DNPは持続可能なより良い社会、より心豊かな暮らしの実現に向けて、事業活動と地球環境の共生を常に考え、環境問題への対応を重要な経営課題の一つに位置づけています。2020年には「DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050」を策定し、「脱炭素社会」「循環型社会」「自然共生社会」の実現に向けた取り組みを加速させています。 CO₂排出量の可視化に関しては、1997年以来、製造するパッケージのライフサイクル全体におけるCO₂排出量を算定して製品の企画・開発に活かすとともに、その算定結果を開示してきました。2021年にはCO₂排出量を自動算定するツールを開発し、その運用や算定に関する社内のマネジメント体制を構築。2022年4月には、そのツールとマネジメント体制について、「SuMPO／第三者認証型カーボンフットプリント包括算定制度」で初となる認証を取得し、「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム」として本格的な運用を開始しました。 現在、本システムを基軸に、長瀬産業株式会社との連携によって、製品のライフサイクル全体でのカーボンフットプリント算定に関するコンサルティングサービスを提供しています＊2。また、Earth hacks株式会社と連携し＊3、製品・サービスのCO₂排出量削減率の数値化や生活者の環境配慮商品の購入促進を行うなど、業界を横断した多様な取り組みを行っています。 ＊2　長瀬産業との連携について →

"783",":Article","2023年9月5日 オンラインで患者の服薬状況を確認できる「服薬サポートサービス」の実証実験を 三重県の広域連携モデル「美村（びそん）」で実施 製品・サービス ヘルスケア・ライフサイエンス 地域創生・まちづくり DX メディカル・ヘルスケア 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、患者の服薬状況をオンラインで確認できる「服薬サポートサービス＊1」を利用して、DNPが取り組む三重県での広域連携モデル「美村（びそん）＊2」プロジェクトと連携した実証実験を開始しました。「美村」は、三重県中・南部の多気町・大台町・明和町・度会町・紀北町が連携し、5町で1つの仮想自治体として、共通のデジタルシステムを活用した魅力的な地域づくりを推進するものです。 今回、「服薬サポートサービス」の実証の第一弾として、本サービスの有用性や診療所や薬局での運用課題などを調査する実証実験を2023年3月～5月に大台町で行いました＊3。2024年度には、対象エリア・規模を拡大した実証実験を予定しています。 実証実験の背景 高齢化等によって在宅医療を受ける患者が増加するのに対して、医療従事者不足などの課題が顕在化しています。そうした中で、在宅での医薬品の服用状況を把握するには、患者の自己申告や事後の確認などに頼る必要があるため、不必要な薬の追加処方、不要な残薬の発生、患者の服薬離脱などにつながる可能性もありました。こうした課題の解決に向けてDNPは、2017年に服薬状況を管理するデバイスとして「服薬管理カレンダー」を開発しました。その後、過疎化・高齢化が進む地域で生活習慣病の薬物治療を対象とした実証実験を進める中で、本デバイスの使用だけでは、医療従事者が患者に介入して服薬の適正化を図ることは難しいという課題も見えてきました。 実証実験の概要 ○　DNPはデジタル田園都市国家構想の一環で、三重県の広域連携モデル事業を自治体やパートナー企業とともに運営し、医療MaaS（Mobility as a Service）など、ICT（情報通信技術）を活かした地域の価値の拡大を進めています。今回、その取り組みと連携し、医療従事者が少ない地域での高齢者の服薬支援のため実証実験を行いました。 ○　「服薬管理カレンダー」には、曜日ごとに朝・昼・夕の食後と就寝前の4つのポケットがあり、各ポケットに服用1回分の薬を1週間分格納できます。カレンダーの裏面には、印刷技術で形成した回路があり、それによって各ポケットと電子モジュールの端子をつないでいます。患者が各ポケットから薬を取り出すと、ポケットの位置と取り出した日時の情報が自動的にクラウド環境で送信されて、記録されます。    服薬管理カレンダーの利用イメージ ○　今回の実証実験では、薬剤師が「服薬管理カレンダー」を通じてオンラインで服薬状況を把握し、診療所や薬局との連携を行いました。外来診療の際には、この情報をもとに医師や薬剤師が指導を行いました。今後、薬剤師が服薬状況をモニタリングする際に、服薬の漏れや間違いを患者にその場で伝えるなど、患者の自立を促すような服薬支援を行うことを目指しています。 実証実験の成果 ○　今回の実証実験を通して、薬局での説明を含めた患者のデバイス活用支援、服薬情報の収集やレポート作成、各種情報の連動などを問題なく行うことができました。患者のアンケートでは、「薬を飲むことについての意識が変化した」「薬の管理を継続できそう」という回答が得られました。また、診療所や薬局からは、外来時の服薬状況の確認において、データに基づいた会話によってより適切な指導につながるという評価を受けるなど、「服薬サポートサービス」の有用性が確認できました。 ○　医療従事者が不足している地域では、薬局を一人で運営している場合も多いため、薬局のスタッフとは別の「オンライン薬剤師」による助言や患者の服薬支援に対する期待が高いことが分かりました。 ○　「服薬管理カレンダー」のポケットへの薬の入れ間違い、患者ごとの服薬忘れの予防（生活リズムとの関連性の把握等）、外来診療のスケジュールとの連動などは、自動送信する情報だけでは管理し切れないため、薬剤師等から患者への定期的なオンラインヒアリングが大切であることも分かりました。 今後の展開 DNPは今回の成果を踏まえ、2024年に、「美村」の複数の診療所・病院・薬局と連携して、薬剤師から患者へのオンラインでの指導を含む第二弾の実証実験を行う予定です。主に高齢化が進む地域での生活習慣病の薬物治療を対象とし、「服薬サポートサービス」の実用化を進め、治療継続率の向上による重症化予防を支援するなど、地域住民の健康寿命の延伸や医療費の適正化に貢献していきます。

Reality）」の技術を活かし、新しい体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーション®事業」を展開しており、今回、「神田明神（東京都）」「世界遺産 仁和寺 国宝『金堂』（京都府 以下：仁和寺「金堂」）」を高精細3DCGデータで制作しました。外観を忠実に再現するため、歴史ある建築物ならではの外壁や木材の質感、屋根の勾配や曲線、また、それらが醸し出す自然な陰影の表現力が特徴です。 9月4日（月）に、「神田明神」を、ソニーピーシーエル株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役 執行役員社長：中村英明　以下：ソニーPCL）が運用するデジタル背景のライブラリー「BACKDROP LIBRARY」＊1で公開、3DCGデータの提供を開始する予定です。なお、「仁和寺『金堂』」は、2023年11月中旬以降に同サイトで公開、提供開始予定です。 現実の「神田明神」 「神田明神」のバーチャルプロダクション用高精細3DCGデータ 【取り組みの背景】 バーチャルプロダクションは、スタジオに設置したLEDに3DCGを背景として投影し、その前で人や物を撮影することで、あたかも現実の世界で撮影したような映像をつくり出す手法です。近年、国内外での利用が拡大していることに対して、高精細の3DCGデータのバリエーションはまだ少なく、使用許諾に時間や手間を要する公共施設や、破損等の防止から保護対象となる文化財等の3DCGでの利活用ニーズが特に高まっています。 このようなニーズ・課題に対してDNPは、文化財のデジタルアーカイブ事業＊2などで培った高解像度画像の変換・加工・最適化技術と、XRコミュニケーション事業＊3で培った3DCG制作の強みを活かし、バーチャルプロダクション用の高精細3DCGデータの提供を開始しました。 【DNPが提供するバーチャルプロダクション用の背景3DCGデータの特長】 １．3DCGデータとして文化財を活用することで、「文化の継承」と「映像制作」に貢献 文化財の多くは「修復・継承」と「公開等の利活用」の両方が求められます。DNPは対象物へ負荷をかけずに3Dデータを取得し、3DCGとしてバーチャルプロダクションへ展開することで、文化財の保存や活用と、映像制作における課題の解決を両立させます。また、文化財の所有者にデータとしての使用対価を還元することで、新たな収益モデルの構築を目指します。 ２．高精細でリアルな背景（ロケーション）用3DCGデータ制作技術 今回、3DCGデータの制作には、DNPが文化財アーカイブ事業などで培った独自の撮影・加工技術による3Dデータ上での微細な凹凸情報等の表現に加え、バーチャルプロダクション特有の撮影に連動したリアルタイムな陰影情報の表現を施しました。それにより、光源の位置や撮影アングルが変化しても、適切な陰の形状や陰影の強弱が表現できます。映像制作会社等は忠実に再現した文化財を背景に使用できるだけでなく、3DCGならではのエフェクト（効果）の使用など、演出の幅を広げることができます。 （上）日中、（下）夕方、日照時間を変更した「神田明神」3DCGデータ カメラアングルを変更した「神田明神」3DCGデータ ３．3DCGデータの制作時間を短縮し、早期提供を可能に DNPは、文化財以外にも国内外で3,000件以上の豊富な計測実績を持つ協力企業と連携し、同社保有の“点群データ”を活かしたバーチャルプロダクション用データを提供します。計測済みの点群データの活用によって、精度が高く臨場感のある3DCGデータを短期間で制作できるため、企業等が求める背景（ロケーション）の早期提供を可能にします。 【今後の展開】 DNPは、バーチャルプロダクションで求められる多様なロケーションニーズに対応するとともに、提供する3DCGデータのさらなる品質向上を推進します。また、関連サービスの展開や海外での販売も視野に入れて、2028年度までに累計20億円の売上を目指します。今後も、地方自治体の文化資源の活用による地域活性化の支援など、さまざまな事業を展開していきます。 ＊1 ソニーPCL「BACKDROP

"786",":Article","2023年9月1日 年齢や言語の違い、障がい等がある人も読みやすい「LLマンガ」の制作サービスを開始 京都精華大学と連携してコニカミノルタウイズユーで実証実験、86％が「読みやすくなった」 製品・サービス 出版・電子出版・教育 教育 デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）グループの株式会社DNPメディア・アート（DMA）は、できるだけ多くの多様な人々にとって読みやすい形式の「LLマンガ」の制作サービスを2023年8月に開始しました。 読み書き障害（ディスレクシア）＊1や自閉症等の人、視力の衰えのある高齢者、日本語を母語としない人など、書籍を読むことに困難がある人々にとって、読みやすく制作する本「LLブック」が海外を中心に流通しています。「LL」は、“やさしくてわかりやすい”という意味のスウェーデン語・Lättläst（レットラスト）の略で、できるだけ多くの人に読書の楽しみや必要な情報を提供することを目指してつくられています。こうした考え方や技術・ノウハウをマンガに展開させたものが「LLマンガ」です。 本サービスの開始に先駆けて、『障害のある人たちに向けた　LLマンガへの招待』（樹村房、2018年）の著作者で京都精華大学教員の吉村和真教授監修のもと、2022年11月〜2023年2月に、コニカミノルタグループ特例子会社・コニカミノルタウイズユー株式会社の社員教育のなかで、「LLマンガ」を活用した理解度向上の検証を行う実証実験を行いました。 実証実験で用いた、「LLマンガ」のガイドラインに沿って作成したマンガ サービス開発の背景 2019年6月に国内で「読書バリアフリー法」が施行され、障がいの有無などに関わらず、すべての国民が等しく読書できる環境を整備する必要性が一層高まっています。そうしたなかでマンガのコンテンツは、ページの構成やコマ割り、説明・表現などが複雑な場合もあり、すべての人にとって理解しやすいとは言えない状況でした。 今回DMAは、読書のバリアフリー対応に対して、この取り組みをマンガコンテンツにも広げ、「LLマンガ」制作のガイドラインとフローを構築して、サービス提供を開始します。これにより、日本語のマンガコンテンツを読むことが困難な人も含めて、できるだけ多くの人がマンガを楽しむことができる環境づくりを目指します。 「LLマンガ」制作サービスのポイント １．マンガ特有の表現を分析し、ストーリー性を配慮してコマを分解するなど、シンプルな設計や改善のレギュレーション（規則等）を構築 ２．ロケーション（場面）や表情による心理表現などを読み取る必要がない作画 場面を示す背景や表情による心理表現などを抑えてセリフで伝えることで、わかりやすさを向上（左のコマの各種情報を右のコマでは抑制） ３．わかりにくいテキスト・文章や複雑なコマ構成の改善 ４．デフォルメや誇張表現をはじめとする「略画表現」の改善 直感的に理解できる文章を心がけるとともに、背景の誇張した表現を抑えることで、わかりやすさを向上（左のコマの各種情報を右のコマでは抑制） 実証実験の概要 コニカミノルタウイズユーの人事制度の説明資料について、従来のテキスト主体の資料をベースに、通常のマンガと、吉村教授監修による「LLマンガ」の二種類を制作しました。この二種類のマンガを知的障害や精神障害を抱える同社のメンバーに読んでもらい、理解度を検証したところ、参加者の約86%が「LLマンガ」の方が「よりわかりやすい」と評価しました。 今後の展開 DMAは本サービスを、2022年に構築したマンガ制作スタジオ「MANGA CREATIVE WORKS®」＊2のコンテンツ制作機能と連動させて、出版社や企業、教育機関などにも提供していきます。DNPグループは本サービスを通じて、「D&I（多様性と包摂）」を一層促進し、多様な人材の育成や障がい者雇用の定着といった企業の課題解決を支援するとともに、継続的な出版文化の発展にも貢献していきます。 ＊１

"790",":Article","2023年8月30日 厚生労働省の「歯周病等スクリーニングツール開発支援事業」に採択 カラーマネジメント技術を活かして歯周病等のリスク検査キットを開発 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス ヘルスケア・ライフサイエンス BPO・業務効率化 DX メディカル・ヘルスケア 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、生涯を通じた歯科健診（いわゆる国民皆歯科健診）＊1の実現に向けた「歯周病等スクリーニングツール開発支援事業」（厚生労働省）に採択されました。この事業でDNPは、印刷で培ったカラーマネジメント技術を活かし、歯周病等のリスク検査をスマートフォンで容易に行えるスクリーニングツールを開発します。また、このツール開発で得られた経験を活かした検査関連業務に向けたBPO（Business Process Outsourcing）サービス、オンライン歯科保健相談などの提供についても検討していきます。 ＊1　国民皆歯科健診：政府が2022年・2023年の「骨太の方針」で掲げた取り組みの一つ　　 　　  歯周病等スクリーニングツール開発の背景 近年の研究で、口内の健康と心臓病・脳卒中・糖尿病等に関連があることがわかってきており、歯周病を予防する事が全身の生活習慣病を予防することにつながると言われています＊2。しかし、歯周病の罹患率は高い一方で、歯科健診の受診率が低いことや歯科健診を実施する歯科専門職の不足等が課題になっています。この課題の解決に向けて今回、厚生労働省が推進する「歯周病等スクリーニングツール開発支援事業」において、DNPの取り組みが採択されました。 ＊2　日本臨床歯周病学会「歯周病が全身に及ぼす影響」 → https://www.jacp.net/perio/effect/ 歯周病等スクリーニングツールおよび関連サービスの特長 ○　九州歯科大学西原達次名誉教授が監修した歯周病原因菌酵素測定試薬「アドチェック®」について、これまでの疫学調査研究成果を外国専門誌に投稿した結果、科学的根拠に基づく歯周病リスク検査として高く評価され、誌上発表されています。このキットを活用し、画像データの色調チェックや補正等を行うDNPのカラーマネジメント技術を掛け合わせ、スマートフォンを用いて容易に歯周病のリスクを評価できるスクリーニングツールを開発します。「アドチェック®」は、採取した舌拭い液＊3に含まれる歯周病原因菌が産生する歯周組織破壊酵素の量によって変化する検出部の色でリスクを判定します。従来は、個人でチェックする場合、利用者が検体を郵送し、歯周病の進行度に即した判断基準に基づいてスコア化していましたが、結果を送付するための処理にかかる時間や人件費などが課題でした。こうした課題に対して、今回開発するスクリーニングツールは、利用者が色の変化した検出部をスマートフォンで撮影し、会員登録したWebサイトのシステムにアップロードすることで自動的にスコアが表示され、その場で判定結果を見ることができます。この際、画像の色補正等を行うDNPのカラーマネジメント技術により、情報端末ごとの色調の差や撮影環境による影響を抑えることで、より的確なリスク判定を実現します。   ＊3　舌表面を傷つけない程度で擦過して、適度に湿潤した舌表面から採取した検体 ○　DNPは、検査前の問診票や検査を促す啓発用の動画など、本ツールの活用促進につながる仕組みやコンテンツの開発も行います。また、自治体等が行う健康診断の運用支援の実績やノウハウを活かし、検査や通知等に関連したデータの処理やコールセンター業務、診療が必要な場合のオンライン歯科保健相談などのサービス開発も行います。 ＜DNPの色調補正技術＞1cm角程度の小さいカラーチャート「CASMATCH（キャスマッチ）」を貼り、画像の色調補正を行います。 ○　自治体や健康保険組合等が歯科健診を実施する場合や、利用者がドラッグストア等で本ツールを購入し自宅などで実施する場合など、さまざまなパターンを想定して、適切なフローの開発や必要機能を検討します。それによって、事業主・利用者・医療機関それぞれにとって利便性の高いパッケージサービスの開発・提供を目指します。 今後の展開 DNPは、「P&I」（Printing & Information：印刷と情報）の独自の強みを掛け合わせ、安全で心豊かな生活を支え、生涯にわたる健康維持を支援する価値の創出に取り組んでいます。その一環として、「歯周病等スクリーニングツール」および運用支援の仕組み等を含む関連サービスの開発を進めていきます。また、実証実験なども行って社会実装を目指し、生活者の歯科医療機関での早期受診も促すなど、社会全体の健康増進に貢献していきます。

"793",":Article","2023年8月10日 大日本印刷と愛媛大学　養殖魚のエサとなる昆虫の自動飼育装置の開発を開始 持続可能な食料供給に向けて、ミールワームによる動物性飼料原料の国産化を目指す ニュースリリース 製品・サービス フォト・イメージング 印刷・加工 コラボレーション 大日本印刷株式会社 国立大学法人愛媛大学 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）と、国立大学法人愛媛大学（所在地:愛媛県　大学長:仁科弘重）は、タイなど養殖魚の飼料（餌）に必要なタンパク質（プロテイン）源として、昆虫のミールワーム＊1の飼育工程の自動化・効率化を目的とした共同研究を開始しました。 ミールワームは養殖魚などのプロテイン源として栄養価が高く、雑食性で繁殖能力も高いことから、サステナブル（持続可能）な食料供給に向けた課題解決策の一つとして期待されています。両者は今後、ミールワームの自動飼育装置を開発し、国内生産性の向上を通じて食のバリューチェーンを支え、食料不足という社会課題の解決に取り組んでいきます。 ＊1　ミールワーム ： チャイロコメノゴミムシダマシの幼虫。 自動飼育装置の開発範囲 昆虫プロテインを配合した飼料のイメージ 昆虫プロテインビジネスに参画する背景 世界的な人口増加や経済発展を背景に、世界の食料需要量は2050年に2010年比1.7倍（58.17億トン）になると予測されています＊2。水産物の需要も拡大すると指摘されていますが、一方で漁船漁業による生産が頭打ちになっており、養殖業への期待が高くなっています＊3。現在は主に、養殖魚の飼料に魚粉が使用され、その原料の多くがカタクチイワシ等の天然資源に依存しているためサステナブルではなく、また近年は、魚粉の価格の高騰＊4やサプライチェーン（供給網）上のリスク等の課題もあります。そこで両者は今回、養殖魚の栄養源となる昆虫プロテインを国内で生産するための自動飼育装置を開発し、持続可能な食料供給の実現を目指します。 飼料用昆虫プロテインは、植物性や他の動物性タンパク源に比べて、栄養価も高く、市場規模は2050年に24.2兆円にまで拡大すると予測されています＊5。 ミールワームの特長 ○終齢幼虫の体長が20mm程度。雑食性で飼育しやすく、繁殖力が高い。 ○植物性や他の動物性のタンパク源に比べ、アミノ酸や不飽和脂肪酸を多く含む。 ○牛などの畜産物と比べると、少ない土地や水で育てることができて、温室効果ガスの排出も少なく、環境負荷が低い。 乾燥ミールワーム（左）と飼料として使われるミールワームの粉末（右） 両者のコメント ○大日本印刷株式会社　執行役員　村上 和郎 DNPはミールワームの自動飼育装置の開発・製造の役割を担い、動物性飼料原料の国産化を目指します。印刷で培った機械設計から大量生産に関する技術や経験、また、「オールDNP」の総合力を生かし、飼育の効率化・自動化に取り組んでいきます。 ○国立大学法人愛媛大学　大学院農学研究科　教授　三浦 猛 愛媛大学はこれまで、昆虫の養殖飼料への利用技術の開発に関する基礎研究を行ってきました。この度、DNPの協力を得て、ついに実際に昆虫を生産し、国産の昆虫による養殖の実現への第一歩を踏み出すこととなりました。これまでの知見を生かし、サステナブルな養殖技術の確立に貢献します。 愛媛大学に新設した実験室 今後の展開 両者は、愛媛大学に新設した実験室で育てたミールワームをプロテイン源として養殖魚に与えて、従来の飼料と比較した魚の成長速度や免疫力を調べる実験を行う予定です。また、ミールワームの自動飼育装置を開発し、2024年3月を目標に、ラボの規模の施設の建設を目指します。将来的には、昆虫プロテインとしてのミールワーム飼育工場を立ち上げ、養殖魚の飼料として年間100トンのミールワーム粉末を水産養殖市場に提供していきます。

"794",":Article","2023年8月8日 耐候性を従来品より大幅に向上させた外装用化粧シートを開発 住宅・非住宅用部材の長寿命化を実現し、省資源・環境負荷軽減にも貢献 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 生活空間 デザイン 環境 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、日差し（紫外線）、気温・湿度の変化、雨・風などにさらされる玄関ドアや外壁等のエクステリア部材を美しく保つ外装用化粧シートの耐候性を当社従来製品と比較してサンシャインウェザーメーター（SWOM）試験で12,000時間＊1と大幅に向上させた新製品を開発しました。 DNPは、市場からの高い評価を長年獲得しているEBコーティング＊2技術を応用・発展させて、生活空間のさまざまな課題を解決する「空間ソリューション」に取り組んでいます。その一環で今回、耐候性の向上によって、住宅や各種施設等の非住宅の長寿命化を実現し、省資源化による環境負荷の軽減などで地球環境にも配慮した外装用化粧シートを開発しました。 耐候性を向上させた外装用化粧シート 【開発の背景】 近年、気候変動の影響などもあり、豪雨や高い気温、強い日差しなど自然環境がより過酷になる中で、一層の耐候性が外装材に求められています。また、循環経済（サーキュラーエコノミー）の実現や住宅・非住宅の長寿命化というニーズに対し、長期間使用できる製品・サービスの開発と、それによる原材料や使用エネルギーの削減など、省資源化・環境負荷軽減の取り組みが企業に求められています。 こうした課題に対してDNPは今回、約20年にわたって提供している「外装用化粧シート」について、表面保護層の耐候剤の工夫、耐傷性や加工性等の塗膜性能の向上、EBコーティング技術の応用によって、大幅に耐候性を向上させました。 【耐候性を向上させた新「外装用化粧用シート」の特長】 屋外環境の気候への耐性を有する「耐候剤」の設計と配合の最適化、DNP独自のEBコーティング技術によって、シート表面の“塗膜”を改良しました。これによって、紫外線による劣化を防止する機能を高め、当社従来製品と比較して約1.25倍の耐候性の向上を実現しました。機能評価の際には、紫外線のエネルギーが太陽光よりも数倍以上高い光源のサンシャインカーボンアーク灯と水噴霧機を使用して、屋外の条件を人工的に再現しました。その中で、製品・材料の寿命を予測するサンシャインウェザーメーター（SWOM）による促進耐候性試験を実施し、12,000時間が経過した後でも、著しい変化が起きないという結果が確認できました。（当社選定のカラー、エンボス仕様による） 本製品の開発にあたり、一定の張力で繰り返し折り曲げてシートの耐久性を調べる「耐折（たいせつ）強度試験」や、シート折り曲げ時の割れの防止状況を調べる「エリクセン試験」等の加工適性評価も行っています。折り曲げなどの加工時に、熱硬化型の製品と比較して、シートがより割れにくいことが確認できました。 表面をより美しく・より長期にわたって保つため、EBコーティング技術の応用・展開によって、耐傷性や耐汚染性を向上させています。 サンシャインウェザー（SWOM）による促進耐候性試験結果。赤枠の試験体に剥離・変色発生が見られる。 【今後の展開】 DNPは、本製品をエクステリア等のメーカーを中心に提供し、2025年度までに累計36億円の売上を目指します。また、今後さらに厳しくなると想定される自然環境に適応したエクステリア製品の開発も進め、住宅市場だけでなく、公共・インフラ市場や海外市場への展開も検討していきます。 ＊1　DNPにおける予測シミュレーションによる実測値 ＊2　EB（Electron Beam：電子線）コーティング ： 塗工した樹脂を電子線の照射で硬化させる技術。ウレタンやUV樹脂をコーティングした製品に比べ、傷・汚れ・日光等に強く、高い耐久性と実用性能、品質安定性を確保できます。製造工程での省エネルギー化やCO2排出量削減、無溶剤塗工も可能な環境対応技術です。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。

"796",":Article","2023年8月4日 サプライチェーン全体でのCO₂排出量データの連動に向けて、「Green x Digitalコンソーシアム」の実証実験に参画 サステナビリティ 環境 環境 コラボレーション データ流通 DX 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、一般社団法人電子情報技術産業協会（JEITA）が事務局を務める「Green x Digital コンソーシアム」＊1で実施した「サプライチェーンCO₂排出量の見える化の実現に向けた実証実験」に参画し、仮想的なサプライチェーンでのCO₂排出量のデータを業界横断で連動させる検証を、2022年10月から2023年6月にかけて行いました。 本実証実験には32社＊2が参加し、サプライチェーン上の各工程にて、異なるシステムで算出したCO₂排出量データを各企業が正しく連動できるかということを検証しました。DNPは、仮想サプライチェーンの上流側から下流側までの、さまざまな仮想的な企業の立場でデータの連動などを行いました。 本実証実験の特長について 世界各国・地域でカーボンニュートラル実現に向けた取り組みが加速するなか、企業に対しては、事業活動にともなうCO₂排出量の削減に加え、サプライチェーン全体でのCO₂排出量（Scope3）の削減が求められています。Scope3での削減を行うためには、原材料調達等の上流から、使用・廃棄・リサイクル等の下流に至るサプライチェーンの各プロセスでCO₂排出量を正確に把握し、全体で排出量データを連動させることが不可欠です。 今回の実証実験では、仮想のサプライチェーンを構築し、企業が持つ固有のCO₂排出量データを異なるソリューション間で連動させることで、サプライチェーン全体でのデータ連動の可能性と想定される課題について検証しました。本実証実験は、国際的な枠組みである「WBCSD PACT」＊3の取り組みを国内で実現することを目指しており、「Green x Digitalコンソーシアム」が策定した「CO₂可視化フレームワーク」と「データ連携のための技術仕様」に基づいて実施しました。グローバルに業界横断を行い、CO₂排出量データを交換することを視野に入れた実証としては、日本で初めての試みです。 CO₂排出量データの見える化に関するDNPの取り組み DNPは常に事業活動と地球環境との共生を考え、持続可能な環境・社会・経済の実現を目指して、環境課題の解決に取り組んでいます。2020年には「DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050」を策定し、「脱炭素社会」「循環型社会」「自然共生社会」の実現に向けた取り組みを加速させています。 CO₂排出量の可視化に関する取り組みとしては、パッケージに関して、一般社団法人サステナブル経営推進機構（SuMPO）が承認した算定結果を提供する「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム CO₂算定サービス」＊4や、長瀬産業株式会社との連携による、製品のライフサイクル全体でのカーボンフットプリント算定に関するコンサルティングサービスを提供しています＊5。また、Earth hacks株式会社と連携し、製品・サービスのCO₂排出量削減率の数値化や、生活者の環境配慮商品の購入促進を行うなど＊6、業界を横断した多様な取り組みを行っています。こうした活動を通してDNPは今後も、サプライチェーン全体でのCO₂排出量の削減に貢献していきます。 ＊1　「Green x Digitalコンソーシアム」のWebサイトURL ： https://www.gxdc.jp/

展示する作品は、各写真家が構想しながらも、これまで実現が困難だった表現技法・表現手法について、DNP・DMAの技術を用いて具現化させたものです。 DMAは、印刷の前工程であるプリプレスやメディア制作を通じて長年培った技術と多様な表現手法を強みとしています。こうした強みを活かして、クリエイターやコンテンツホルダーとともに、写真を中心としたアート作品や各種コンテンツの創作活動を行っており、「DNPプラザ」内の「表現工房」にて企画展を開催しています。 ■「∞（Infinity）2023」の開催概要 ○会期 ：

■今回出展する写真家と展示作品、本人コメント 河西 美穂（かさい・みほ）：2002年生まれ、山梨県出身。東京ビジュアルアーツ 写真学科 写真作家コース在学中。展示作品「雪解け」。「このシリーズは自分から見える実家の空気感や色を撮った作品です。懐かしくあたたかな空気に包まれながらも、目を背けたいことはあって。でも向き合いたいから写真を撮りました。」（展示期間：8月11日〜17日） 土性 愛美（どしょう・まなみ）：1997年生まれ。2023年、日本写真芸術専門学校卒業。展示作品「BREATHE」。「女性としてのアイデンティティを探求し、表現している中で、被写体が持つイメージや伝えたいことに沿った紙や素材でビジュアルを制作しました。」（展示期間：8月18日〜24日） 大中道 彬浩（おおなかどう・あきひろ）：2000年、千葉県生まれ。東京綜合写真専門学校在学中。展示作品「潮騒」。「ありふれたものが非現実的なイメージに変化している写真を作品化しました。写真のリアリティは、私たちに世界の別の側面を見せてくれるはずです。」（展示期間：8月25日〜31日） 孫 佳奈（そん・かな）：中国浙江省生まれ。2023年、日本写真芸術専門学校卒業後、東京造形大学に編入学（在学中）。展示作品「SLOUGH」。「そもそもの『本来の私』はいつ頃から現れ始め、どんな姿をしていたのか。考えが止まらない｡『本来の私』を探究するため、写真の古典技法で私自身と同世代の人たちのシルエットや、白い痕跡を写真にするプロジェクトを行いました。」（展示期間：9月1日〜7日）","B-51","[""日本写真芸術専門学校"",""写真展"",""東京綜合写真専門学校"",""∞(Infinity)2023"",""写真専門学校"",""株式会社DNPメディア・アート"",""東京ビジュアルアーツ"",""DNP"",""メディア"",""共創写真展"",""DMA"",""専門学校"",""東京・市谷"",""表現工房"",""DNPプラザ"",""アート"",""会場"",""BREATHE"",""Infinity"",""グループ"",""共創"",""イベント

"798",":Article","2023年8月2日 環境配慮型「ラベル伝票」を宅配・通信販売・物流業者に提供開始 有機溶剤を使わない剥離紙を用いて製造時のCO2排出量を削減 製品・サービス 印刷・加工 環境 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、宅配・通信販売・物流の事業者等に提供してきた「ラベル伝票」について、製造工程で有機溶剤を使わない剥離紙に切り替えることで、CO2排出量を削減する環境配慮型の「ラベル伝票」を開発して、提供を開始します。 宅配便には荷物の送り先等の情報を記載した伝票が貼付されています。令和3年度の宅配便取扱個数は49億5323万個で、前年度と比較して約2.4%増加しており＊1、荷物に貼付する送り状の「ラベル伝票」の数量も増加しています。DNPは、この「ラベル伝票」について、環境配慮型製品への切り替えを進めることで、2025年時点で年間700トン以上のCO2排出量の削減を見込んでいます。 ＊1　令和３年度 宅配便取扱実績について（国土交通省） → https://www.mlit.go.jp/report/press/jidosha04_hh_000255.html 段ボールに貼った「ラベル伝票」のイメージ 「ラベル伝票」から剥離紙をはがすイメージ 開発の背景 デジタルネットワークの進展とスマートフォン等の情報端末の普及に加え、コロナ禍での外出制限などもあり、オンラインショッピングの利用が広がっています。配送量が増えるにつれて、荷物に貼付する送り状の「ラベル伝票」も増加していますが、従来は剥離紙の製造工程で有機溶剤が使われており、剥離紙の製造時に揮発した有機溶剤を回収して燃焼処理する工程でCO2が排出されていました。 今回DNPは、その排出量の削減に向けて、有機溶剤を使わない剥離紙に切り替えることでCO2の排出量を抑えた「ラベル伝票」を開発しました。 概要と特長 ○製造工程で有機溶剤を使わない剥離紙に切り替えることで、CO2排出量を削減します。 ○「ラベル伝票」のように、異なる用紙を複数の層に重ねて貼り合わせる製品は、一般的に反りや歪みが発生しやすいという課題がありました。この課題に対して今回、材料構成や工程を工夫することで、従来品と同等の品質で「ラベル伝票」を製造できるようになりました。 環境負荷の低減等に向けたDNPの取り組みについて DNPは常に事業活動と地球環境の共生を考え、環境問題への対応を重要な経営課題のひとつに位置付けています。2020年3月には「DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050」を策定し、「脱炭素社会」「循環型社会」「自然共生社会」の実現に向けた取り組みを加速させています。特に「脱炭素社会」の実現に向けては、2050年度までに自社拠点での事業活動にともなうCO2等の温室効果ガス（GHG）排出量を実質ゼロにする目標を掲げるとともに、製品・サービスを通じたGHG排出量の削減を進めています。 今後の展開 今後、DNPグループで製造する大半の「ラベル伝票」を環境配慮型に切り替えていく予定です。また、「ラベル伝票」以外の製品でも、環境配慮型の製品への切り替えを検討していきます。 ※ニュースリリースに記載された製品の仕様、サービス内容などは発表日現在のものです。その後予告なしに変更されることがありますので、あらかじめご了承ください。 ","B-52","[""ラベル伝票"",""有機溶剤"",""剥離紙"",""加工 環境 大日本印刷株式会社"",""製造工程"",""CO2排出量"",""環境配慮型"",""製造"",""宅配"",""提供開始 有機溶剤"",""荷物"",""削減 製品"",""CO2排出量"",""こと"",""伝票"",""事業者"",""サービス"",""送り状"",""CO2"",""提供"",""通信販売・物流"",""印刷"",""販売"",""通信"",""物流業者"",""宅配便"",""製品"",""送り先"",""ラベル伝票"",""排出量"",""情報"",""課題"",""環境配慮型製品"",""イメージ"",""こと"",""削減"",""実現"",""ラベル伝票"",""脱炭素社会"",""環境配慮型"",""数量"",""宅配便取扱個数"",""工程"",""GHG排出量"",""排出量"",""切り替え"",""地球環境"",""こと"",""削減"",""開発"",""宅配便取扱実績"",""削減"",""こと"",""工程"",""自然共生社会"",""こと"",""製品"",""外出制限"",""コロナ禍"",""循環型社会"",""こと"",""国土交通省"",""press/jidosha04_hh_000255.html"",""事業活動"",""取り組み"",""スマートフォン"",""普及"",""情報端末"",""オンラインショッピング"",""利用"",""進展"",""背景 デジタルネットワーク"",""段ボール"",""経営課題"",""サービス"",""DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050"",""共生"",""配送量"",""GHG"",""DNPグループ"",""歪み"",""低減"",""予定"",""材料構成"",""品質"",""同等"",""品"",""切り替え"",""ひとつ"",""対応"",""環境問題"",""環境負荷"",""温室効果ガス"",""目標"",""自社拠点"",""概要"",""大半"",""展開"",""層"",""複数"",""用紙"",""ニュースリリース"",""仕様"",""サービス内容"",""もの"",""2"",""2025年"",""2020年3月"",""2023"",""8"",""2023年8月2日"",""3"",""49億5323万"",""2.4"",""1"",""2025"",""700"",""1"",""３"",""000255"",""2020"",""3"",""2050"",""2050""]","0.010230297701467031","0.0022549745675711163","0.004335173909522146","5.903388282403122E-4","true","[0.117493495,0.11476566,0.07173527,0.065264516,0.064797215,0.06300657,0.045083534,0.04338534,0.04049367,0.028871844,0.025942799,0.02294288,0.02217397,0.020819874,0.01613161,0.013652295,0.013652295,0.013329759,0.011483256,0.011056789,0.0109062,0.0109062,0.0109062,0.0109062,0.007895292,0.007861637,0.006775682,0.0056577562,0.0048296265,0.004624283,0.0044681216,0.0036106608,0.0035694982,0.0032286425,0.0031951168,0.0031951168,0.0030908405,0.0027871197,0.0026300894,0.002471446,0.0021271412,0.0021271412,0.002024033,0.0020063196,0.0019812249,0.0019741182,0.001954429,0.001726137,0.0016084419,0.0015994363,0.0015994363,0.0015718271,0.0013407535,0.0012935743,0.0012239885,0.0011712561,0.0011632686,0.0011335661,0.001122169,0.0010543036,0.0010370514,0.0010362031,0.0010362031,9.811706E-4,9.811706E-4,9.6650963E-4,9.6650963E-4,9.6650963E-4,9.6650963E-4,9.6650963E-4,8.923983E-4,8.923983E-4,8.923983E-4,8.345324E-4,7.996465E-4,7.9571316E-4,7.67958E-4,6.3208654E-4,6.271566E-4,6.199531E-4,5.6977704E-4,5.4519786E-4,5.337126E-4,5.118858E-4,5.118858E-4,5.118858E-4,5.118858E-4,4.949626E-4,4.6458523E-4,4.6458523E-4,4.6458523E-4,4.6458523E-4,4.4511896E-4,4.4511896E-4,4.4511896E-4,4.066089E-4,3.7873042E-4,3.7873042E-4,3.6066584E-4,3.6066584E-4,3.6066584E-4,3.273803E-4,3.273803E-4,3.273803E-4,3.273803E-4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]","/Users/smallcat/Documents/GitHub/graph/dnp/kg/data/newsrelease_B-1-100_C-1-4/B-52.txt",,,,,,,

"803",":Article","2023年7月28日 室内空間に豊かな質感を与えるフローリング用化粧シートを発売 安らぎと落ち着きのある“新質感”と温室効果ガス削減などの“環境対応”を両立 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 生活空間 デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、目に優しい反射光や心地よい手触りなどの豊かな質感を備え、室内空間に安らぎや落ち着きを与えるフローリング用化粧シート「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ® フロア プレミア」を2023年度に発売します。 本製品は、マンション等の室内ドアや収納・内装部材として高い支持を得ている「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ」シリーズのフローリング用の上級グレード品として、安らぎや落ち着きが求められるインテリア空間をつくり出します。DNPは、長年にわたり市場の高い評価を得ているEBコーティング＊1技術のさらなる進化による「空間ソリューション」のひとつとして、室内空間の質的価値を向上し、地球環境にも配慮した“人と環境にやさしい”高質感内装化粧シートを開発しました。  同一の光源による従来品（左）と新製品の「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ フロア プレミア」（右）の比較 【開発の背景】 DNPは、木目柄などを印刷したオレフィン系樹脂フィルムに、独自のEBコーティングを施すことにより、耐候性や耐傷性、耐汚染性の向上と環境対応を両立させた「DNP EBオレフィンシート サフマーレ」＊2を建具、フローリングなどにシリーズ展開しています。近年は、コロナ禍をきっかけの一つとして、テレワークなどの新しいライフスタイルが定着し、家で過ごす時間が増える中、より“安らぎ”や“落ち着き”がある住宅・インテリア空間が求められるようになりました。空間を彩る化粧材としても、人へのストレスが少なく、地球環境にも配慮した“人と環境にやさしい”製品が求められています。 こうしたニーズに対してDNPは今回、フローリングに必要な従来の機能を維持しながら、丁寧に仕上げた無垢材から感じる艶や手触りまでの質感を高めた「DNP EBオレフィンシート　サフマーレ フロア プレミア」を開発しました。 【「サフマーレ フロア プレミア」の特長】 １．艶を抑えることで、不快な光の反射や表面の白濁現象を低減 新たに開発した特殊コーティングによる本製品は、日光や照明によってフロア表面に生じる光の反射や白濁現象を低減し、目に優しい柔らかな反射光にします。この効果により、鉋（かんな）で丁寧に仕上げた無垢材のような落ち着いた“低艶感”を表現できました。 ２．シルクのような心地よい手触り 本製品の特殊コーティング層が、滑らかに仕上げた木地やシルクに近い凹凸の起伏と幅を形成することで、心地よい手触りを実現しました。表面の滑りやすさを計測したところ、シルクに近い摩擦値が確認できました（DNP調べ）。 ３．製造における温室効果ガスの排出量削減など環境に配慮 電子線硬化型インキを使用するDNP独自のEBコーティングは、熱硬化型インキで生産した場合と比べ、温室効果ガス（GHG）の排出量を約15%、揮発性有機化合物（VOC）排出量を約30%低減できます＊3。 【今後の展開】 DNPは集合住宅や一戸建て住宅への導入に向けて、ハウスメーカーや建材メーカーなどに当製品を販売し、2024年度までに累計約4億円の売上を目指します。なお、本製品は、DNP社員を窓口に社外のパートナーにご利用いただいているプレゼンテーション&コラボレーション施設「P&Iラボ・東京」の「Technologyエリア」に展示しています。 ＊1　EB（Electron Beam：電子線）コーティング ： 塗工した樹脂を電子線の照射で硬化させる技術。ウレタンやUV樹脂をコーティングした製品に比べ、傷・汚れ・日光等に強く、高い耐久性と実用性能、品質安定性を確保できます。製造工程での省エネルギー化やCO2排出量削減、無溶剤塗工も可能な次世代型の環境対応技術です。 ＊2　サフマーレ（Safmalle）： SAFE（安全な・危険のない）とMALLEABILITY（適応性・順応性）という言葉を組み合わせたDNPの建材用オレフィンシートの総称。「環境･健康配慮」を意味する造語。DNPは、焼却しても有害なガスがほとんど発生しない環境配慮材料のオレフィンの活用や、シックハウス症候群の原因とされる化学物質の不使用など、環境や健康に配慮した製品開発を推進しています。また、EB樹脂のバランス設計によって用途に合わせた機能を付与することで、MALLEABILITYを実現しています。

"805",":Article","2023年7月26日 警視庁の「サイバーセキュリティ訓練」をメタバース上で実施可能に ロールプレイング型の訓練で、迅速・適切なサイバーセキュリティのインシデント対応方法を習得 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス XR 認証・セキュリティ 認証・セキュリティ DX メタバース 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、警視庁サイバーセキュリティ対策本部による、サイバーセキュリティに対する危機管理訓練や認知啓発を目的とした「メタバースを利用した訓練実施委託」に採用されました。 本事業では、DNPが2023年7月13日に提供を開始した「ロールプレイング型のメタバース構築サービス」＊1を活用し、サイバーセキュリティ関連の不測の事態（インシデント）が発生した際の迅速かつ適切な対応方法の習得に特化した訓練を行います。警視庁職員をはじめ、「サイバーセキュリティ人材の育成に関する産学官連携についての協定」（2022年7月26日締結）＊2の関係者（警視庁・大学・DNP等の企業）に向けて、2024年1月19日（金）にサービス提供を開始する予定です。   バーチャル空間イメージ 【メタバースを利用したサイバーセキュリティのインシデント訓練実施の背景】 警視庁は、国外からのサイバー攻撃など現在のサイバーセキュリティ情勢に基づいて、インシデントに対する理解と備え、関係者への啓発を強化しています。今回、警視庁職員を中心とした受講者が、メタバースを利用した訓練を通じて、インシデント発生時の企業等の立場や対応への理解を深めるとともに、適切な対処方法を学びます。また、あえて不適切な内容を含む対処方法を体感的に学ぶことで、実務での迅速かつ適切な対応につなげ、サイバーセキュリティ対応力の底上げを図るとともに、より多くの人々に体験してもらうことを目的にメタバース上で展開していくこととなりました。 DNPはリアルとバーチャルの空間を連動させて、新しい体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーション®事業」を推進して、さまざまな企業・団体のメタバースの構築・運用を手掛けています。また、DNPグループの運営する「サイバーナレッジアカデミー」では、インシデントに適切に対処できる専門人材を育成する「サイバーセキュリティ人材育成事業」を展開しており、今回これらの実績やノウハウを活かして、メタバースを利用したサイバーセキュリティのインシデント訓練を支援します。 【メタバースを利用したサイバーセキュリティのインシデント訓練の概要】 メタバース上でサイバーインシデント発生時の一連の対応訓練を実施。 DNPが株式会社AKIBA観光協議会と運営するメタバース「バーチャル秋葉原」上に、警視庁サイバーセキュリティセンターを設置し、サイバーセキュリティの認知啓発を図るコンテンツを発信。 ■メタバースを利用した主な訓練の特長 サイバーインシデントが発生した際は、攻撃を受けた企業等のさまざまな関係者と警察が連携し、迅速かつ適切な対応を行う必要があります。そうした対応方法を習得する今回のメタバース訓練には、以下の特長があります。 時間や場所の制約が少ないメタバースに複数の受講者が同時に参加して訓練を行います。1グループ4名を基本として、同時に10グループまでの接続が可能で、多くの受講者が学べる環境を提供します。 各参加者に組織上の役割（ロール）を割り当て、インシデント発生時に必要となる対応について訓練で学びます。 メタバース上で各参加者は、ボイスチャット機能を活用して互いにコミュニケーションを取りながら、協力してシナリオを進めていきます。 参加者は実際の訓練に加え終了後の振り返りを通じて、サイバーインシデント発生時に企業が一般的に行う対処法を理解し習得することができます。 【今後の展開】 DNPは今後も、「ロールプレイング型のメタバース構築サービス」を活用して、同様の訓練だけでなく研修やワークショップ等の取り組みについてもメタバースならではの実体験に近い体験価値を提供していくことで、企業や各種団体の活動を支援していきます。 ＊1　DNPの「ロールプレイング型のメタバース構築サービス」について →

DNPは、北秋田市の伊勢堂岱遺跡のガイダンス施設である伊勢堂岱縄文館に、DNPコンテンツインタラクティブシステム「みどころキューブ」を含む、最新のデジタル技術を活用した鑑賞システムを開発・導入しています＊2。「みどころキューブ」は、デジタル庁主催の2022年度「good digital

"809",":Article","2023年7月21日 メタバース空間「京都館PLUS X」とTikTokの連動で新たな地域の魅力を発信 映像クリエイター「ぞのさんっ」の京都をテーマにした限定映像を公開し相互送客を図る ニュースリリース メタバース コラボレーション 地域創生・まちづくり 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、京都市、一般社団法人渋谷未来デザイン、TikTok（ティックトック）とともに、京都の魅力発信拠点であるメタバース空間「京都館PLUS X」＊1とTikTokを連動させたプロモーションを実施します。 本企画は、TikTokで大人気の映像クリエイター「ぞのさんっ」＊2が制作した、京都市の観光名所を舞台にしたショート動画をメタバース空間とTikTokそれぞれで公開し、相互送客を図ります。 DNPは今回の取り組みを通じて、地方活性化に向けた課題である若い世代へのアプローチや、地域の認知度向上を図っていきます。今後も、メタバース空間における新たなプロモーションの可能性と、そうした活動が創出する価値の検証を続けていきます。  ぞのさんっ制作TikTok映像、バーチャル空間「京都館PLUS X」イメージ 【メタバースとTikTok連動プロモーションの背景と狙い】  2018年に東京駅八重洲口にあった「京都館」を閉館した後、京都市は、DNPと連携して、メタバース空間「渋谷区立宮下公園 Powered by PARALLEL SITE」＊3内で、2022年に「京都館PLUS X」を開設しました。同年、多様なバックグラウンドのゲストが年齢・職業等の垣根を越えて参加する「SOCIAL INNOVATION WEEK SHIBUYA 2022」（渋谷未来デザイン主催）＊4にて、デジタル技術を活用した本企画が考案され、ゲストの一人「ぞのさんっ」と、TikTok・京都市・DNPの連携がスタートしました。TikTokが持つ情報拡散力やコミュニティー力と、メタバース空間の三次元（3D）の表現力、参加者のアクティブなコミュニケーションや体験機会など、お互いの強みを掛け合わせた新たなプロモーションを展開します。  【プロモーション概要】  ○公開期間 ： 2023年7月21日（金）～  ○公開先 ：  ・京都館PLUS X ： https://shibuya-miyashitapark.parallel-city.jp/project/kyotokan/  ・ぞのさんっTikTokアカウント： https://www.tiktok.com/@zono.sann  ■映像クリエイター「ぞのさんっ」  1992年兵庫県生まれ。一級建築士。約300万人（2023年6月末時点）のフォロワーがいるTikTokクリエイター。会社員を経て宿泊事業で起業。コロナ禍を機に映像クリエイターとしての活動を開始。自身のサロン「CREATEE」の代表を務める。ウィル・スミス氏が紹介する世界11の国・地域のクリエイターとして日本人で唯一選出。  【今後の展開】  DNPは、XR（Extended Reality）技術を活かして人々の体験価値を高める「XRコミュニケーション®」＊5事業を推進しており、その一環で、誰もがいつでも簡単に安全・安心に楽しめる空間の構築に必要な機能を備えたXRロケーションシステム「PARALLEL SITE®」を提供しています。若年層も含めた幅広いユーザーに向けて、安全・安心にメタバースを楽しむ体験機会を創出するとともに、メタバース空間による地域活性化の機会の創出を探求していきます。  今後も、京都市とともに、各種イベントと連動した京都の魅力を発信することで、生活者と京都市をつなぐ要（ハブ）となる「京都館PLUS X」を構築・運用していきます。  ＊1　メタバース空間「京都館PLUS X」

大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、2023年7月21日（金）に日本最大級の貝塚を有する千葉市立加曽利（かそり）貝塚博物館で行われる「夏休み縄文ウィーク」にて、メガネ型の情報端末“スマートグラス”を利用した情報表示ガイダンスシステムに関する実証実験を行います。 今回、スマートグラスの内蔵カメラで撮影する画像情報から利用者の位置情報を算出するVPS（Visual Positioning System）技術や、リアルとバーチャルが相互に影響し合う空間等を構築するMR（Mixed Reality：複合現実）技術を活用します。この情報表示ガイダンスシステムにより、実際の博物館内で鑑賞する人の位置に合わせて、貝塚の断面や竪穴住居の柱、土器等の情報を重ねて、スマートグラスで立体的に表示する“場所に応じたMR”のサービスを提供します。 加曾利貝塚博物館貝層断面展示での利用イメージ

DNPは、美術館・博物館向けにヘッドマウントディスプレイ（HMD）やスマートグラスを使用したガイダンスシステム＊1を提供しており、各種情報機器やMRに関する実績やノウハウを有しています。機器の内蔵カメラで取得した画像情報から利用者の位置情報を算出してMRを体験する鑑賞システムでは従来、高機能かつ高価なHMDを利用してきましたが、今回、HMDよりも低価格なスマートグラスを利用します。今回のガイダンスシステムでは、従来必要だった位置情報算出用のマーカー等を施設内に設置する必要がありません。施設側の導入・運用の負荷が少なく、利用者も手軽に使用できるシステムとして、実証実験で効果や課題を検証します。 【情報表示ガイダンスシステムの実証実験のポイント】 １．所定の位置で自動的に解説等のコンテンツを表示 スマートグラスの内蔵カメラで取得した展示物等の画像によって利用者の位置を特定するため、これまで必要だった位置特定用のマーカー等の設置が不要です。スマートグラスをかけて所定の場所で展示物を観ると、該当する解説コンテンツ等が速やかにスマートグラスに表示されます。今回の実証実験では、加曽利貝塚博物館内の貝層断面の展示を観ると、周囲に掘られた調査区の様子がMRで表示され、発掘当時の現場にタイムスリップできます。 ２．現実の世界とCG等のコンテンツを違和感なく配置 バーチャルに表示するCG等の解説コンテンツを、スマートグラスを通したリアルな空間上の最適な位置に、高い精度で配置できます。そのため、解説コンテンツ等が現実世界と一体化しているような自然な表示が可能になり、利用者の直観的な理解や満足度の向上につながります。今回の実証実験では、「加曽利E式土器」展示ケースの前で4点の土器の3次元（3D）CGをMRで表示します。実物の展示では観ることができない土器の裏側などを好きな角度から鑑賞できます。また、「大形建物跡」の展示の前では、MRで床に表示する竪穴住居跡の上に柱を再現することで、建物の大きさなどをわかりやすく伝えます。 ■実証実験の開催概要 ○日時 ： 2023年7月21日（金）　10:00～15:00　（12:00～13:00は昼休み） ＊7月19日（水）～22日（土）に開催する「夏休み縄文ウィーク」の中で１日のみ実施します。 ○場所 ： 加曽利貝塚博物館（千葉市若葉区桜木8丁目33-1） ○参加方法 ： 当日、加曽利貝塚博物館にて、先着順で20～30名に整理券を配布します。

"814",":Article","2023年7月13日 理解と共感を促すロールプレイング型のメタバース構築サービスを提供開始 7月13日（木）開催の「Metaverse Japan Summit 2023」にて概要を初公開 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス XR DX メタバース 教育 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、参加者に対し、各種シナリオを通じて理解と共感を促すロールプレイング型のメタバース構築サービスの提供を7月13日（木）に開始します。本サービスは、複数の参加者がコミュニケーションしながら、シナリオにある課題解決やイベント参加などを行うもので、多様なテーマについて楽しみながら理解・共感を深めるゲーミフィケーションの要素を盛り込んでいます。 DNPは2021年から、リアルとバーチャルの空間を連動させて、新しい体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーション®事業」を展開しています。その一環で今回、安全・安心に楽しめるバーチャル空間を構築するXRロケーションシステム「PARALLEL SITE®（パラレルサイト）」の機能を拡充し、企業の研修やワークショップ、自治体等の防災教育などの用途で本サービスを提供します。  ロールプレイング型のメタバースのイメージ 【開発の背景】 国内では今、多くの企業や自治体等が、広告・宣伝・販売促進等の目的でメタバースの利用を進めています。その中で、現状では、静止画や動画を鑑賞するショールーミング型のサービスが多く、メタバースの利用者同士が積極的なコミュニケーションを行いにくいという課題がありました。企業や自治体等からは、メタバース内でのコミュニケーションをより活発にする仕組みへのニーズも高まっており、そうした課題解決に向けて今回、ロールプレイング型に特化したメタバース構築サービスを開発しました。 DNPは、2021年に構築したメタバース「渋谷区立宮下公園 Powered by PARALLEL SITE」を活用し、謎解きブームの仕掛け人・松丸亮吾氏が企画し、複数の参加者が同時に楽しめる謎解きイベントを開催してきました。それらのノウハウも活用して、今回のサービスを開発しています。 【ロールプレイング型に特化したメタバースの特長】 １．教育・イベントなど幅広いシナリオに対応  本サービスは、「チュートリアル（操作方法）」「シナリオ体験」「フィードバック（体験結果に対する評価・解説）」のテンプレート（ひな型）で構成されています。教育やワークショップ、謎解きイベントなどのさまざまなシナリオで、ロールプレイング型のメタバースを提供できます。各シナリオは、1グループ4名を基本として複数名の参加が可能です。同じ時間帯に最大10グループまで体験できるため、大規模な企業研修やイベントなどにも活用できます。チケット機能によって参加者を限定することもできます。この機能を活用することで、有償でのサービス提供も可能となります。 ２．ロールプレイングを通じてよりアクティブな学びにつなげる 「シナリオ体験」では、それぞれの役割に割り当てられた参加者が、さまざまな課題やイベントをその役になりきって解決・達成していきます。各参加者は、ボイスチャット機能を活用して互いにコミュニケーションを取りながら、協力してシナリオを進めていきます。「フィードバック」では、各参加者が達成状況に応じて評価されます。参加者は個々の内容を振り返り、自身の課題発見や成長につなげることができます。メタバース内で繰り返し学ぶことができるため、複数の役割を体験することも可能です。 ３．さまざまな企業・団体等が連携し、個別のニーズに合わせたシナリオを提供 企業・自治体・団体等のニーズや課題に応じて、多様なシナリオを作成できます。DX人材育成研修や、地域に根差したリアル宝探し、SDGsについて楽しみながら学べる謎解きなど、学習・研修・イベント等の企画にとどまらず、幅広いジャンルで企業・団体等との連携を通じてシナリオを提供し、そのラインアップを今後も拡充していきます。 【価格（税込）】 ○空間利用料：900万円～／件　○運用費：50万円～／月 ※このほか、初期セットアップ費、シナリオ組込費が別途必要です 【今後の展開】 DNPは、本サービスを企業・自治体等の学習・研修・イベント等に提供し、関連サービスを含め、2028年度までに累計20億円の売上を目指します。 また、7月13日（木）に渋谷ストリームホールで開催される「Metaverse Japan Summit 2023」＊1にて、本サービスの展示と講演を行います。なおDNPは、同サミットを主催する一般社団法人Metaverse Japanで発足する教育をテーマとするワーキンググループに参画します。 ＊1　「Metaverse Japan Summit 2023」の詳細 → https://mvjsummit.com/mvjs202307/ ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。

"815",":Article","2023年7月12日 カカオ豆の種皮を活用したリサイクルボードを開発し、快適な空間などを表現 株式会社 明治の「CACAO STYLE ROOM」として提供 製品・サービス マーケティング・セールスプロモーション 環境 コラボレーション デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、株式会社 明治が取り組む「ひらけ、カカオ。」プロジェクト ＊1の一環として、カカオ豆の種皮「カカオハスク」を活用したリサイクルボードを開発しました。また、このリサイクルボードを用いて新たに作った家具や内装材で、快適な空間を表現して来場者に提案するショールーム「CACAO STYLE ROOM」を企画・制作しました。 この「CACAO STYLE ROOM」は、明治が立ち上げた、カカオハスクのアップサイクルをテーマにした新ブランド「CACAO STYLE」 ＊2のプロモーション用ブースとして活用されます。  明治の「CACAO STYLE ROOM」 ＊壁、ベッド、テーブル、イス、棚に「カカオハスクボード」を使用。カカオハスクを活用した床材はfabula株式会社より、カカオハスクで染色したベッド周りの布類と棚やテーブルの装飾品（「CACAO STYLE」製品）は明治より支給いただきました。 ＊1 「ひらけ、カカオ。」のWebページ ： https://www.meiji.co.jp/sustainability/newaction/cacao/ ＊2 「CACAO STYLE」のWebページ : https://www.meiji.co.jp/sustainability/newaction/cacao/cacaostyle/ 「カカオハスクボード」と「CACAO STYLE ROOM」について ○ DNPグループは、工場の廃材や廃棄衣料品等を加工した再生素材を活用してリサイクルボードを作成し、その特徴を活かしたPOPや什器などをデザインして提供しています ＊3。そうした実績とノウハウを活かし、今回明治と共同で、チョコレートを作る過程で排出されるカカオ豆の種皮「カカオハスク」を活用した再生素材由来の「カカオハスクボード」を開発・作成しました。 ＊3　再生素材を活用したデザインソリューション ： https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/10161743_1567.html ○ 「カカオハスクボード」は、カカオハスク約30％、廃棄衣料約60％、DNPの工場廃紙約10％を粉砕・圧縮・成形して作成しています。従来提供している繊維リサイクルボードと同等の強度があります。 ○ また、「カカオハスクボード」と積層段ボールを組み合わせて家具や内装材を作成し、居住空間等として表現した「CACAO STYLE ROOM」を企画・作成しました。 ○ 「CACAO STYLE ROOM」は、イベント用のブースとして多くの人に紹介することも想定しており、積層段ボールを折りたたみ・組み立てが容易な構造にすることで、多様な場所での設置や撤収の負荷低減も可能にしました。 今後の展開 循環型社会の実現に向けて、多くの企業では、製品等の製造過程で発生する廃棄物等を再生素材として活用するニーズが高まっています。こうした動きに対して、DNPは早くから、自社工場での損紙やリサイクル材を活用して、その価値を高める「アップサイクル」の取り組みを行っています。＊4　特に使用期間が短い店舗POPやショールームのブースには、リサイクル材を活用したいという需要が高く、DNPはリサイクル材を使用しながら強度や利便性の高い製品の開発を進めています。 今後もDNPは、循環型社会の実現に向けて、空間の企画・設計や什器製造などの技術・ノウハウを活かし、多様な廃棄素材の活用に取り組み、素材の特長を活かした付加価値のある製品への再生（アップサイクル）を推進していきます。 ＊4　アップサイクルに関するDNPの取り組み事例 ：       ・「Recycling Meets Design® Project」 ：

"817",":Article","2023年7月10日 生活者の脱炭素アクションを推進するEarth hacks株式会社と業務提携 環境配慮パッケージにCO₂削減率スコアを付与し、環境配慮商品の購入を促進 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス 生活用品向けパッケージ 食品・飲料向けパッケージ ヘルスケア・ライフサイエンス サステナビリティ 環境 環境 コラボレーション 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）は、脱炭素社会の実現に向けた生活者一人ひとりのアクションを推進するEarth hacks株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:関根澄人）＊1との業務提携を2023年7月に開始します。DNPは、商品・サービスのCO₂排出量削減率をスコア化するEarth hacksの「デカボスコア」＊2の取り組みに対し、パッケージ領域でのCO₂排出量の算定やそのスコア表示の促進、生活者向けイベントなどで連携して、環境に配慮した商品・サービスを生活者が選択しやすい社会の実現に貢献します。 ＊1　Earth hacks株式会社について → https://earthhacks.jp/ ＊2　「デカボスコア」について → https://decarbo.earth-hacks.jp/about/   業務提携の背景と狙い カーボンニュートラルの実現に向けて、国内外の多くの企業が環境負荷の少ない商品・サービスの提供を進め、生活者が環境に配慮した商品を選ぶ“エシカル（倫理的な）消費”が広がり始めています。しかし、国内市場でのエシカル消費の浸透はまだ十分ではなく、自治体や企業にとって、生活者が自発的かつ継続的に環境配慮商品・サービスを選ぶ市場を確立することが大きな課題となっています。 そうした課題に対して、2023年5月に株式会社博報堂と三井物産株式会社が設立したEarth hacksは、生活者が脱炭素アクションを選択したくなる動機づけや選択後の貢献実感に着目し、主に1990年代後半から2010年代に生まれた“Z世代”を中心とした生活者に向けたコミュニケーション手法の開発に取り組んでいます。特に環境配慮商品・サービスが選ばれるには、業界を越えて活用できる環境配慮に関する共通表示（マーク）が有効であると考え、CO₂排出量削減率をわかりやすく数値化した「デカボスコア」を通じて、生活者の脱炭素アクションを促しています。DNPはこの取り組みの理念に賛同し、今回パッケージ領域のパートナーとしてEarth hacksと連携し、生活者の環境配慮商品の購入および企業の環境配慮パッケージ導入を促進していきます。 業務提携による取り組みのポイント＊3 DNPは、“環境に配慮した商品・サービスであること”が生活者の購買動機となるよう、「デカボスコア」の活用を推進します。また、原材料調達から廃棄・リサイクルまでのライフサイクル全体で、企業が環境に配慮した選択をする動機づけにつなげることで、社会全体の脱炭素アクションの拡大を目指します。こうした取り組みを通じて、「DNP環境配慮パッケージング GREEN PACKAGING®」＊4の価値の最大化に努め、その導入を促進します。 外部機関として一般社団法人サステナブル経営推進機構（SuMPO）が承認した算定結果を提供する「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム CO₂算定サービス」＊5により、環境に配慮したパッケージのCO2排出量を算定します。その結果等に基づいて、商品と生活者の接点と言えるパッケージに「デカボスコア」を表示するなど、さまざまな形で当スコアの活用を支援します。 Earth hacksは、商品・サービスの「デカボスコア」を街なかで体験できる「マルシェ」や、脱炭素をテーマにしたZ世代と企業による共創チャレンジなど、生活者参加型のイベントも展開しています。DNPは、こうした取り組みの企画段階から実行段階までさまざまな形で連携し、環境をテーマにした生活者と企業のコミュニケーションを支援するとともに、生活者による脱炭素のアクションを促進していきます。

DNPは常に事業活動と地球環境との共生を考え、持続可能な環境・社会・経済の実現を目指して、環境課題の解決に取り組んでいます。2020年には「DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050」を策定し、「脱炭素社会」「循環型社会」「自然共生社会」の実現に向けた取り組みを加速させています。また、包装関連製品の売上における「GREEN PACKAGING」の比率を2030年度に100%にすることを目指します。 今後も、本取り組みを推進するとともに、環境に配慮した商品・サービスの価値の向上に努め、すべての業種・業界等のステークホルダーとともに持続可能な環境・社会・経済の実現に取り組んでいきます。

"820",":Article","2023年7月5日 より効果的なIR（Investor Relations）活動を支援する「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」開始 株主が企業と接する体験（IX）からIR活動の課題を可視化して最適な施策を提案 製品・サービス 企業コミュニケーション DX 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、投資等を通じて株主が企業と接する体験を「株主体験（インベスターエクスペリエンス：IX）」と捉えています。今回、企業に対する株主の信頼や愛着心（ロイヤルティ）の向上に影響が大きい企業のIR活動とその課題を特定・可視化して、より効果的なIR活動を支援する「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」の提供を2023年7月1日より開始しました。 「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」開始の背景と概要 個人投資家の増加等を背景に、企業がIR活動を通じて株主とのコミュニケーションの質や企業に対する株主のロイヤルティを高め、長期的な株式の保有等につなげる重要性が見直されています。一方で従来は、株主を対象とした調査の結果をロイヤルティ向上やコミュニケーション活性化の具体策に反映しにくいといった課題がありました。 こうした課題の解決に向けてDNPは、株主ロイヤルティの向上につなげる「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」を提供します。このサービスは、株式会社エモーションテックが開発した投資家体験マネジメントサービス「EmotionTech IX」の分析ロジック（※特許取得済）をもとに、DNPオリジナルの調査設問で個人投資家のロイヤルティを把握。株主が重要だと考える「株主体験」や、改善すべきIR活動をスコア化して特定します。また、その実現に向けた各種IRツールやコンサルティングの支援を行うことで、個人株主と企業の対話を促進し、企業価値の向上を支援します。 DNPは、企業のマーケティング活動を支援する「DNP CXマネジメントサービス」＊1を2018年から提供してきました。このサービスは、顧客ロイヤルティ指標であるNPS®（Net Promoter Score）＊2を用いたアンケートによって、重要な顧客体験（カスタマーエクスペリエンス：CX）の特定や顧客接点の課題を可視化し、カスタマージャーニーマップを用いて分析するものです。本サービスのマーケティング関連の実績に、IR関連のコミュニケーション支援のノウハウ・実績を掛け合わせて、今回、「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」を設計しました。 「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」の特長 株式会社エモーションテック「EmotionTech IX」の分析ロジックをもとに、株主ロイヤルティに影響を与える可能性がある因子（コミュニケーション手法やコンテンツ内容等）として、企業活動関連の20項目とIR活動関連の39項目をDNP独自に設定し、各項目を調査・分析していくための個人株主アンケートを実施します。 株主のロイヤルティ向上の課題となる「株主体験」について、ロイヤルティへの影響度と改善優先順位をともに明らかにします。（図中①） IR活動における「株主体験」を中心に評価理由を深掘りできるチェック項目を設定し、株主のロイヤルティ向上に寄与する改善の方向を提示します（図中②）。また、株主総会や統合報告書など、株主と企業のコミュニケーションの施策・ツール・コンテンツについて、改善提案につなげることが可能です。 今後の展開 DNPは「DNP IXマネジメントサービス」を活用して企業のIR活動を支援し、関連サービスも含めて2025年までに累計で10億円の売上を目指します。 ＊1　「DNP CXマネジメントサービス」 ： https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/1189699_1567.html ＊2　NPS®は、Bain&Company, Fred Reichheld,

"821",":Article","2023年7月4日 大日本印刷と長瀬産業　製品のCO₂排出量削減に向けたコンサルティングサービスを開始 化粧品等の内容物からパッケージまで、製品ライフサイクル全体のカーボンフットプリントを算定 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス ヘルスケア・ライフサイエンス 生活用品向けパッケージ 食品・飲料向けパッケージ 環境 コラボレーション 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:北島義斉　以下:DNP）と長瀬産業株式会社（本社:東京　代表取締役社長:上島宏之）は、化粧品等の製品のライフサイクル全体におけるカーボンフットプリントのコンサルティングサービスを開始します。二社は2023年7月4日から、製品のCO₂排出量の算定と削減を支援するサービスとして、医薬・化粧品業界などに提供します。 　　 サービス開始の背景 近年、サプライチェーン全体でカーボンニュートラルを目指す企業の取り組みが加速しています。経済産業省と環境省は2023年5月に、カーボンフットプリントの算定・表示等に関する実践的なガイドを公表し、企業にCO₂排出量の可視化の仕組みづくりや情報開示を求めています。しかし、カーボンフットプリント算定に向けたデータ収集やロジック設計には専門のノウハウが必要であり、また、集計・算定の負荷が高いため、現状は、排出の実績値を測定・収集するのではなく、業界平均等のデータから推定する方法が主流となっています。こうした方法では正確な実態を把握しにくく、CO₂排出量削減の施策を講じても、効果を算定結果に反映できないといった課題がありました。 こうした課題の解決に向け、パッケージ製造に関するCO₂排出量の算定に長年取り組んできたDNPと、化学業界を中心にカーボンニュートラルを支援してきた長瀬産業は今回、両社の強みを掛け合わせ、ライフサイクル全体のカーボンフットプリントを算定するコンサルティングサービスを提供します。 サービスの特長 ①	企業の自立的な算定を支援 製品のカーボンフットプリントを算定するために必要な、データの収集方法や算定ロジックの確立など、内容物からパッケージまで企業が自立して算定できるようご支援します。 ②	企業のCO₂削減の取り組みなども反映させた精度の高い製品カーボンフットプリントの算定 両社が保有する「CO₂排出係数」を用いた算出方法によって、内容物からパッケージまで含めた製品全体の、より正確なカーボンフットプリントの算定を実現します。企業のCO₂削減の取り組みによる削減量を算定結果に反映するとともに、削減効果の高い取り組みの把握なども可能になります。 サービスイメージ 両社の強みについて ○〔DNP〕　パッケージのライフサイクル全体のCO2排出量について、一般社団法人サステナブル経営推進機構（SuMPO）に承認された算定結果を提供する「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム　CO₂算定サービス」＊1を提供しています。2022年10月には、環境配慮デザインチーム「DNP GREEN PARTNER」＊2を立ち上げ、環境問題を解決する企業・団体の取り組みを総合的に支援しています。今回もこれらのノウハウを活用し、サプライチェーン全体でCO₂排出量の削減に貢献します。 ＊1　「DNPライフサイクルCO₂認証システム CO₂算定サービス」について→

○〔長瀬産業〕　カーボンニュートラル実現に向け、化学系専門商社として培ったネットワークやノウハウを活かし、サプライヤーや顧客企業などサプライチェーン全体のCO₂排出量の可視化・削減支援を進めています。金融機関との共同の取り組みとしてモデル事例にも採択された「サステナビリティ・リンク・ローン・フレームワーク」や国内外のイニシアチブへの参画、CO₂排出量算定ツールやデータ連携サービスを活用し、化学品メーカーのほか、塗料・化粧品・アパレル・スポーツ用品・出版・印刷・繊維・半導体関連装置等の幅広い業界の脱炭素経営を支援してきました。今回も、化学業界およびグローバルでのネットワークを活かし、さまざまな提案とサービスの充実を加速していきます。 今後の展開 両社は本コンサルティングサービスを通して、企業とともに、製品のライフサイクル全体でのカーボンニュートラル実現に向けたさまざまな改善に取り組んでいきます。 なお、DNPは、7月5日（水）〜7日（金）に東京ビッグサイトで開催される「第25回インターフェックスジャパン[医薬品][化粧品]製造展」＊3に出展し、CO₂削減などに貢献する「DNP環境配慮パッケージング GREEN

今回、本展に登場する恐竜を「生息していた時代」「化石の産出地」「特性」で分類して、「恐竜博2023 みどころキューブ」を制作しました。利用者の興味・関心に応じた直感的な操作で、恐竜についてより多角的・体系的に学ぶことができます。 本ツールは、実際の企画展とあわせて、展示内容をさらに深彫りして楽しめる仕掛けとして、会期中にウェブ上にて公開しています。（https://images.dnpartcom.jp/cube/dino2023/） 「恐竜博2023みどころキューブ」：鑑賞者は立方体の見る角度を自在に変えて、多様な関連情報を得ることができる ■演出のポイントと企画協力への想い(DNP社員・宮澤悠大) 会場の入口で「なんだろう？」と興味を持つきっかけづくりや、企画展で出会った多様な恐竜を体系的に学べるように工夫しました。営業として顧客のマーケティング企画に携わってきた経験と、副業の「恐竜コンサルタント」＊2としての経験を活かして協力しました。自分も幼い頃に恐竜と出会って大好きになったように、多くの方々に、恐竜の魅力に触れて、恐竜ファンになってもらいたいです。 ＊2　Discover

大日本印刷株式会社（以下：DNP）と株式会社ガバメイツ、さいたま市は、同市の「自治体の窓口業務に関するBPRの効果検証」＊1に関する協定書を締結し、2023年7月から、さいたま市西区役所の窓口業務（一部）を対象とした効果検証を実施します。BPR（Business Process Re-engineering）は、既存の業務プロセスの課題等を明確にして、その解決を図ることであり、今回の効果検証を通じて、市民や職員の手続き業務の負荷軽減などにつなげていきます。 ＊1　さいたま市ホームページ → https://www.city.saitama.jp/006/014/008/003/012/004/p097713.html 効果検証実施の背景 2025年度末までの実現を目指す「自治体情報システムの標準化・共通化」＊2など、全国の自治体ではさまざまな行政の仕組みのデジタル化を進めており、その実現に向けてBPRの必要性が高まっています。さいたま市では、行政手続に関する市民負担の軽減や職員側の業務効率化に向けて、「書かない窓口」の実現を目指しています。この取り組みは、申請や手続き業務のデジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）を推進して、来庁者が（申請書等を）“書かない”・（長時間）“待たない”などの窓口を構築・運用するものです。 その実現に向けて今回三者は、さいたま市西区役所の健康福祉部における一部の窓口業務に関して、既存業務の量・プロセス・課題等を把握し、市民サービスの向上と業務の効率化につなげるため、検討・分析・検証を行います。 ＊2　総務省「自治体情報システムの標準化・共通化」 → https://www.soumu.go.jp/menu_seisaku/chiho/jichitaijoho_system/index.html 効果検証の概要 ○期間 ： 2023年7月～2023年8月（予定） ○場所 ： さいたま市西区役所健康福祉部 ○内容 ： 健康福祉部の窓口業務（一部）に関する「書かない窓口」の実現に向けて、以下の視点でBPRの効果検証を行い、その有効性を確認します。 　　　（1）既存の業務フロー・処理時間・対応人員等の可視化 　　　（2）他の自治体との業務プロセスの比較 　　　（3）業務遂行における問題点・課題等の抽出と、原因の分析 　　　（4）「現状業務（As Is）」から、「現実的解（Can-Be）」、「あるべき姿（To-Be）」へのフローの作成 　　　（5）以下の観点を踏まえて、業務改善につなげていく事項の検討 　　　　　・新たなデジタルツールの導入 　　　　　・関連システムとの連動 　　　　　・アウトソーシングの可能性探索 　　　　　・業務の廃止・削減・分担・標準化・計画化・容易化・同期化など DNPグループとガバメイツの強み ○DNPグループ ： 企業・団体等の業務を受託するBPO（Business　Process Outsourcing）事業に加え、BPO導入に不可欠なBPR関連の知見・実績を豊富に有しています。2023年1月には、BPO・BPR関連のサービスの強化・拡大に向けて、専門のグループ会社「株式会社DNPコアライズ」を設立。BPRによって既存業務を整理し、デジタルツールの導入やBPOとの掛け合わせ等によって、自治体の課題の解決や構造改革の推進を支援します。 ※DNPのBPRコンサルティングサービス

自治体向けDXサービスを提供する合弁会社として、株式会社チェンジとコニカミノルタパブリテック株式会社が2022年に設立。2023年2月時点で200以上の自治体の業務量調査結果や業務手順データを有しています。自治体職員へのヒアリングに基づいた効率的なBPRの計画設計や研修、導入効果の推測が可能です。また、これらのデータを活用した行政専用の「総合行政ネットワーク（LGWAN）」対応の業務改革支援ツール「Govmates Pit」の提供も可能です。 ※ガバメイツについて → https://govmates.jp/ 今後の展開 さいたま市は、DXコンセプトとして「さいたまデジタル八策(はっさく)」＊3を策定しており、DXによる行政サービスの向上と業務の効率化を目指しています。その一つに「行政手続きのデジタル化」を掲げ、本効果検証の結果をもとに「書かない窓口」の実現に向けた取り組みを推進していきます。また、DNPグループとガバメイツは、両社の強みを掛け合わせた自治体向けBPRサービスを拡大し、自治体の課題解決や業務改革の推進、生活者の利便性向上の実現などを支援します。

"825",":Article","2023年6月30日 メタバースで企業と生活者、地域をつなぐファン・コミュニティの構築を継続支援 「ブルボンメタバース」を6月29日にリニューアルオープン！ 製品・サービス XR メタバース コンテンツビジネス コラボレーション 地域創生・まちづくり 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）が開発を支援している、株式会社ブルボンのインターネット上の仮想空間「ブルボンメタバース」＊1が6月29日（木）にリニューアルオープンしました。  DNPは2021年からXR（Extended Reality）技術を活かし、リアルとバーチャルの空間を融合して体験価値を高める「XRコミュニケーション®」の事業を展開しています。その一環で、2022年10月には利用者がアバターとなってブルボンの歴史や商品の魅力を体験できる「ブルボンメタバース」の構築を支援しました。この仮想空間は、「お菓子が持つ楽しさ」と、ブルボン本社がある「新潟県柏崎市の魅力」を一体化した新たなコミュニティです。今回、DNPが推進する「地域」「コンテンツ」「マーケティング」領域の取り組みを融合することで、「企業と生活者」「企業と地域」両面のブランディング向上を目指す常設のメタバース空間として、さらなるファンの獲得とファン同士のコミュニティの活性化につなげていきます。  ＊1　「ブルボンメタバース」WebサイトURL リニューアル版「ブルボンメタバース」 【リニューアルした「ブルボンメタバース」の特長】  1．お菓子のテーマごとに3エリアで表現し、仮想の本社ビルに「くまのてせん」「会議室」などを新設！  仮想のお菓子の空間を「ビスケット・チョコレートエリア」「グミ・キャンデーエリア」「米菓エリア」の3エリアで表現し、各所にブルボンのお菓子を配置。お菓子の木、チョコ噴水のほか、グミやキャンデーをモチーフに作った橋や、米菓のイス・テーブルなど、ブルボン商品の「楽しさ」を感じられる空間にしました。仮想の本社ビル1Fには、「くまのてせん」列車が「プチアイランド」を走るジオラマを新設し、 利用者は「プチシリーズ」の世界観を体験できます。また、「会議室」を新設することで、メタバース上で商談を行うなど、ビジネス用途にもチャレンジしていきます。  2．取得したコインに合わせて新アバターが使える！  コインを集めてカプセルトイを回す従来の機能に加えて、「コインの枚数に応じて使えるアバターが増える」機能を追加しました。かわいらしさが増した、さまざまな衣装の「ルマンドちゃん」や、ブルボンのあの名物キャラクターなど、最大10種類のアバターを選べて、「ブルボンメタバース」をより楽しむことができます。  3．柏崎市の魅力発信を強化！  仮想の本社ビル屋上で、柏崎市の高精細360度パノラマの風景に、地元のお店や施設を体験できる機能を追加しました。風景上に点在するアイコンをタップすると、アバターがその場所のフォトリアルなメタバース空間に入り、各所を疑似体験できます。また、新たに屋台風のブースを設置し、地元の催事や名物などを紹介することで、地域のブランディング向上も目指します。

DNPは今後も、「ブルボンメタバース」をはじめ、多様な業種の企業や団体等のメタバース空間の構築・運用を支援し、各種製品・サービスの認知拡大、ファンの獲得やファン・コミュニティの活性化につなげていきます。生活者に向けた新たな情報発信や交流の場としてメタバースの活用を支援することで、企業・団体等のブランディング の向上にも貢献していきます。  ■「ブルボンメタバース」の推奨動作環境 ：

"826",":Article","2023年6月27日 大日本印刷と図書館流通センター 「ライトアニメ」を活用して映像化した学習マンガや絵本を電子図書館向けに販売開始 効果的に楽しく学べる動画教材を自治体・学校に提供 製品・サービス 出版・電子出版・教育 DX 教育 コンテンツビジネス 大日本印刷株式会社 株式会社図書館流通センター 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）とグループ会社の株式会社図書館流通センター（TRC）は共同で、従来のアニメーション制作手法と比較して大幅に「早く」「安価に」制作できる「ライトアニメ」＊1を活用して学習マンガなどを映像化し、自治体や学校の電子図書館向けコンテンツとして提供を開始します。 その第一弾として、株式会社朝日新聞出版の「週刊マンガ日本史　改訂版」シリーズの6タイトルを、2023年6月27日（火）から販売します。 ＊1　「ライトアニメ」について → https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/20168507_1567.html    ©Kazue Kato/Asahi Shimbun Publications Inc. /  ©Haruhiko Mikimoto/Asahi Shimbun Publications Inc. 背景 コロナ禍をきっかけの一つとしたオンラインサービスの拡大、「GIGAスクール構想」に基づく学習過程でのタブレット端末利用の拡大、「デジタル田園都市国家構想推進交付金」の支給などにともない、自治体や教育機関では、電子図書館サービスやデジタルコンテンツの需要が高まっています。TRCが提供する電子図書館の導入自治体は、2018年3月末時点の60件から、2023年5月末時点の330件へ、約5年で約5.5倍に増加しました。一方で、電子図書館向けコンテンツは従来、文字中心のコンテンツに適した「EPUB」という電子書籍形式が主流であり、映像コンテンツの供給が十分でないという課題がありました。 そうした課題に対してDNPは、従来のアニメーション制作と比較して大幅に「早く」「安価に」制作できる「ライトアニメ」を活用して、コンテンツホルダーから使用許可を受けた学習マンガや絵本などを映像化します。また、TRCが提供する電子図書館サービス「LibrariE＆TRC-DL」＊2を通じて、自治体（2023年5月末時点で330自治体）や学校に販売していきます。 ＊2　LibrariE & TRC-DL：学校図書館・公共図書館等での国内導入実績NO.1の電子図書館サービス。https://www.trc.co.jp/solution/trcdl.html ライトアニメを活用した電子図書館向けコンテンツの特長 「ライトアニメ」は、アニメーション用の原稿を描き起こす従来の制作手法に対し、マンガの原稿をそのまま活用し、着彩（色付け）や分割処理、アクション（動作）の付加などを行って動画コンテンツにするもので、制作の期間とコストを従来のアニメ制作手法と比較して大幅に抑えることができます。 今回、学習マンガの特性を考慮して、セリフや説明については完全に音声化せず、文字を素材として活かした形で制作します。 映像化により、「隙間時間を活用するなど気軽に学べる」「視覚と聴覚を使うことで内容の理解や記憶の定着がしやすい」「飽きずに楽しく学べる」といった、学習における新たな価値を提供します。 ■第一弾の提供コンテンツについて 「週刊マンガ日本史　改訂版」シリーズ（株式会社朝日新聞出版発行）のうち、以下の6タイトルを、2023年6月27日より販売します。 ①「映像版 マンガ日本史 聖徳太子」(約11分)		マンガ：加藤和恵 ②「映像版 マンガ日本史 坂上田村麻呂」(約12分)		マンガ：細雪純 ③「映像版 マンガ日本史 源頼朝」(約16分)		 マンガ：清瀬のどか ④「映像版 マンガ日本史 上杉謙信」(約12分)		マンガ：山田孝太郎 ⑤「映像版 マンガ日本史 渋沢栄一」(約19分)		マンガ：甘夏柑子 ⑥「映像版 マンガ日本史 津田梅子」(約15分)		マンガ：美樹本晴彦 今後の展開 DNPとTRCは、出版社をはじめとしたコンテンツホルダーとの連携を強化し、学習マンガのほか、絵本やビジネスマンガなどにもジャンルを拡げて、学びにつながる動画コンテンツの拡大を図ります。 またDNPは、電子図書館向けに映像化した作品について、動画配信プラットフォームや放送事業者をはじめ、多様な業種の企業などにグローバルに販売して、コンテンツ価値の最大化を図ります。

"829",":Article","2023年6月23日 大日本印刷とUltimatrust 自律走行搬送ロボットの経路を最適化するシミュレーターを開発 アニーリング技術によるアルゴリズムでロボットの最適経路を短時間で導き、搬送時間を短縮 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス BPO・業務効率化 データ流通 AI DX 大日本印刷株式会社 Ultimatrust株式会社 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）と、デジタルツインプラットフォーム「Wisbrain（ウィズブレイン）」＊1を展開するUltimatrust（アルティマトラスト）株式会社は、物流倉庫や飲食店等で稼働する自律走行搬送ロボット（Autonomous Mobile Robot：AMR）の経路を最適化するアルゴリズムと、その導入効果を検証できるシミュレーターを開発しました。 「Wisbrain」は、設置した多様な情報機器から取得したデータを集約し、AI（人工知能）で高精度な解析を行うシステムです。今回、このシステムに、膨大な選択肢から最適な解を抽出する「組合せ最適化問題」を高速で処理する「DNPアニーリング・ソフトウェア（DAS）＊2」を搭載しました。DASは量子コンピュータで用いられるアニーリング手法を、GPU（Graphics Processing Unit）を利用した並列計算により高速化したソフトウェアです。 これにより、常に変化するAMRや障害物等の位置を把握して最適な移動経路を短時間で計算し、AMRの稼働率を高めます。また、シミュレーターにAMRの台数や稼働領域マップ、経由地等の条件を設定することで、このアルゴリズムの効果を検証することができます。 左：シミュレーションのイメージ、右：各ロボットの移動距離を示したシミュレーション結果（10台のAMRすべてにおいて、従来の手法と比べて移動量が下回っていることが確認できる） 【開発背景】 近年、日本国内ではサービスの多様化に対して労働力が不足していることなどにより、業務の一層の効率化が急務となっています。そのため、一部の工場や倉庫のみで使用されてきたAMRの用途を広げ、多様な現場に導入していく動きが進んでいます。ロボットが得意とする作業を積極的に任せることで、人が担う仕事の幅が広がり、生産性も向上するという実績が増えています。 こうした課題や動向に対してDNPとUltimatrustは、さらなる社会の持続可能性と生産性の向上に貢献するため、両社の技術を掛け合わせ、複数のロボットを同時に効率よく制御することで、AMRの一層の有効活用を促進します。 【開発したアルゴリズムとシミュレーターの特長】 １．AMRの移動距離を従来手法と比べて約3分の2に短縮 DNPのDASを活用し、現場の環境やロボットの稼働状況等の膨大な選択要素の中から、「AMR同士の衝突回避」や「現場全体での高効率なロボットの動作順序」等の条件を加味して、最適な搬送経路を提示します。 今回の開発にあたり、125×200mの倉庫内でランダムに抽出した8つの経由地を各AMRが通るという条件で、10台のAMRをシミュレーター上で稼働させたところ、最短経路を導くために従来から使われているダイクストラ法と比べて、AMRの移動距離が約34%短くなりました。 ２．突発的に発生した障害物などにもリアルタイムで対応可能 物流倉庫や飲食店等では、ロボットの経路上に障害物が突発的に発生する場合がありますが、本アルゴリズムでは、「Wisbrain」を通じてカメラやセンサーから得る障害物の情報を活用することで、経路をリアルタイムで再探索できます。障害物の存在を前提に経路を提示するため、衝突や停止の事前防止につながります。 ３．AMRのさまざまな作業環境に広く対応 物流倉庫や製造工場、飲食店など、AMRが導入されるさまざまな環境に対応可能で、ロボットの稼働効率を高めたい企業・団体等に有効です。 【今後の展開】 両社は、物流倉庫や製造・物流関連の企業、飲食業界等に向けて、PoC（Proof of Concept：概念実証）等を通じて、ロボット導入による効果検証を示していくほか、2023年度中に、本アルゴリズムを用いたAMRの経路最適化システムを開発し、提供していきます。 大日本印刷株式会社		所在地：東京都新宿区　代表取締役社長：北島義斉 Ultimatrust株式会社		所在地：東京都千代田区　代表取締役社長：小澤巌 ＊1　Wisbrainの詳細について→

"831",":Article","2023年6月22日 AIで校正・校閲の省力化をするサービスに文法チェックや多言語対応の機能を拡充 DX化で多様な業界の業務効率化を支援 製品・サービス BPO・業務効率化 AI DX 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、AIを活用して製品のパッケージや広告物、契約書等の校正・校閲・審査業務の省力化を支援する「DNP AI審査サービス（校正・回覧業務）」＊1に、「日本語の誤用などのチェック」「表組みの校正・校閲チェック」「多言語対応」の新機能を追加し、2023年6月22日に提供を開始します。新機能の実装により、サービス提供する業界を拡大し、校正・校閲・審査業務のDX（デジタルトランスフォーメーション）を推進します。 ＊1　「DNP AI審査サービス（校正・回覧業務）」について　→　https://www.dnp.co.jp/biz/solution/products/detail/10159174_1567.html 新機能開発の背景 顧客・生活者とのコミュニケーション手法・接点等が多様化し、社員の働き方改革が進むなか、製品パッケージ・広告物・契約書など企業の各種制作物に関して、業務プロセスの管理等はより複雑になっています。その工程の中でも特に、校正・校閲・審査業務は属人的であることが多く、多くの業界で省力化や人的ミスの低減などの品質担保が課題となっています。 こうした多くの業界で共通する課題の解決に向けて、DNPは、画像・文字認識技術や自然言語処理技術を活用した「DNP AI審査サービス」を提供しています。そのなかで今回、金融・飲料・食品・メーカー・自治体・教育などさまざまな業界・団体ごとの業務フローや要望を取りまとめ、特にニーズの高かった機能を開発し、追加しました。 今回追加した機能 1.日本語の表記ゆれ・文法の間違い・誤字・誤入力などのチェック機能 価格の表記方法や特定の言い回し、法令で定められたマーク表示方法など、ルールをAIに学習させ、そのルールに基づいてチェックをします。このチェック機能に、文法の間違いや誤字・誤入力、媒体ごとの表記のゆれなどを指摘する機能を新たに追加しました。   日本語チェック：誤りや不自然な日本語を指摘 2.表組みチェック機能 生命保険・損害保険・メーカー等、料金表の表組みは、商品の価格やスペックといった重要な情報が多く、文字も細かいため、複数名が読み合わせを行うなど、校正業務の負荷が高くなっていました。今回の新機能では、表組みの中から文字情報を抽出し、用語等の一覧データや正しいデータと照合して、一致しない箇所を自動的に判別します。 表組チェック：原稿情報と表組の差異をチェック 3.多言語対応 各国・地域に展開している製品・サービスは、広告物やパッケージ等を多言語で制作する必要があるため、その校正も非常に難易度が高く、間違いが発生するリスクも高くなっていました。英語・中国語・韓国語に対応し、各言語のテキストデータを抽出して、正しい情報と比較してチェックします。その他の言語は、順次PoC（概念実証：Proof of Concept）を実施していく予定です。   多言語チェック：多言語の原稿と記載情報の差異を指摘 ■主な用途 飲料・食品会社 ： 商品パッケージの校正・校閲など 生命保険・損害保険会社 ： 募集文書の校正・校閲など クレジットカード会社 ： パンフレットや約款の校正・校閲など 通信会社 ： 広告物の校正・校閲など 銀行 ： 契約書類の審査など 自治体 ： 行政手続きの審査など メーカー各社 ：

"832",":Article","2023年6月21日 4つの地域課題に注目した自治体向けメタバース・パッケージサービスを提供開始 “産業振興”や“窓口相談業務”などの課題に対して、簡易な実証から利用が可能 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス XR 地域創生・まちづくり DX メタバース 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は、インターネット上の仮想空間「メタバース」を活用して、自治体が抱える「地域の魅力発信」「産業振興の促進」「相談業務の支援」「地域コミュニティーの活性化」に寄与するパッケージサービスの提供を開始します。 DNPは2021年から、リアルとバーチャルの空間を融合する「XR（Extended Reality）」の技術を活かし、新しい体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーション®事業」を展開しています。また、人々がいつでも簡単かつ安全・安心に楽しめる空間を構築するXRロケーションシステム「PARALLEL SITE®（パラレルサイト）」も提供しています。今回、これらの機能を活用して、地域の課題解決に向けて簡易的な実証段階から利用できるサービスを開発し、全国の自治体向けに提供します。 「相談業務の支援」におけるメタバース利用のイメージ 【自治体向けパッケージサービスの概要と特長】 １．自治体向けに4つの課題に対応したパッケージにしたサービス (1)地域の魅力発信 メタバース内で、地域の観光資源をより深く知ることができる謎解きイベントや、地域の歴史・文化をテーマとした生涯学習を行うなど、幅広い分野での多様な企画の実施を支援します。メタバースならではのインタラクティブな体験により、各地域に対する利用者の興味・関心を高めます。 「地域の魅力発信」としてメタバースで謎解き実施のイメージ (2)産業振興の促進 メタバースでショールームや期間限定で開設する“ポップアップストア”などを構築し、地域の商品・サービスの販売や催事・イベントの開催などを支援します。また、自治体内の小中学生を対象に、地元企業の職業体験の機会を提供して、その魅力を感じてもらうなど、“シビックプライド”の醸成につなげる企画もサポートします。  (3)相談業務の支援 セキュリティ性の高いメタバース空間で利用者の匿名性を確保することで、暮らしや子育てなどの相談業務にも対応できるように支援します。チャット等のテキストだけのコミュニケーションでは、相談内容の意味やニュアンスが伝わりにくいこともありますが、利用者が自身の分身となるアバターを活用することで、相談の効果をより高めていくことにもつながります。 (4)地域コミュニティーの活性化 場所や時間等の制約が少ないメタバースに、地域の住民や関係者を集めることで、お互いの交流を促進します。自治体およびその地域の人々と気軽に関われる“関係人口”を増やすことで、対象地域への高い関心および帰属意識の醸成などにつなげていきます。 ２．多様なコミュニケーション機能の利用も可能 画像・動画コンテンツの掲出、音声でやり取りできるボイスチャット、「楽しい」「すてき」等のスタンプによる利用者の感情の表現など、さまざまなコミュニケーションの機能をメタバース内で利用できます。 ３．メタバースの構築運用で得たノウハウを提供 DNPは、自治体と連携して「渋谷区立宮下公園Powered by PARALLEL SITE」や「札幌市公認PARALLEL SAPPORO KITA3JO」、「バーチャル秋葉原」、「デジタルモール嬉野」など多様なメタバースを構築してきた実績があります。DNPは自治体等がメタバースを本格導入する前の実証実験の企画設計から、空間の構築、本格的な運用まで、ワンストップで支援します。 【価格（税抜）】 ○初期費用 ： 200万円～ ○月額利用料 ： 30万円～ 【今後の展開】 DNPは引き続き、自治体の各部署が抱える課題に対応した新たな機能・サービス等を開発・拡充することで、地域の課題解決や創生に貢献していきます。なお、2023年6月28日（水）～30日（金）に東京ビッグサイト・東7ホールで開催される「第3回スマートシティ推進EXPO」のDNPブース（ブース番号：31-20）で本サービスを紹介します。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。

"833",":Article","2023年6月20日 ポストクッキー時代のターゲティング広告の配信・分析サービスを提供 改正電気通信事業法に対応、仮想ユーザーIDを用いたLotame社のサービスを日本初導入 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス マーケティング・セールスプロモーション コラボレーション DX データ流通 AI 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：北島義斉　以下：DNP）は、米国のLotame（ロタメ）社＊1と株式会社ゲシェル＊2と連携し、サードパーティークッキー＊3（以下：クッキー）に依存しないターゲティング（追跡型）広告の配信・分析サービスの提供を2023年5月25日に国内で開始しました。 近年、ユーザーのプライバシー保護の観点からクッキーに関する規制が強化されています。クッキーに依存しないデジタル広告の戦略・施策の構築が急がれるなか、DNPは個人情報を使わない安全・安心なサービスを提供します。                 サービス開始の背景と概要 改正個人情報保護法（2022年4月1日施行)や改正電気通信事業法（2023年6月16日施行)等により、プライバシー保護の観点からクッキーの利用が制限され始めており、2024年後半には全面的に廃止される予定です。これにより、生活者のWebサイト閲覧履歴等に基づくターゲティング広告や、分析・効果測定が困難になるため、広告媒体社や広告主は、クッキーに依存しないデジタル広告戦略と施策の構築を急いでいます。 こうした課題に対してLotame社の提供するサービスは、ユーザー個人の閲覧履歴を追跡せずに、Webサイト来訪に関わる各種データの関連性を推定して統合することで、ユーザーの人物像を想定することができます。これにより、クッキーを使わずに、ターゲティング広告の配信や来訪ユーザーの分析が可能になります。 サービスの特長 サービスイメージ：ユーザーが提供を許諾した各種データを収集 → 収集したデータの関連性を推定し統合  １．個人情報を使わない 個人情報や、個人情報に関連する情報を用いないため、よりセキュアな状態での広告配信が可能になります。また、情報収集に関するユーザーからの同意を得る方法として、事前承諾に加え、通知・公表などの対応も可能になります。また、すでにクッキー利用が廃止されたApple社のWebブラウザー・Safariでの利用も可能で、今後廃止予定のWebブラウザーでの利用も可能となる見込みです。 2．ユーザー像を仮想してターゲティングができる ユーザーのWebサイト閲覧履歴を追跡することなく、ユーザーが提供を許諾した各種データ（Web経由・モバイル経由・インターネット回線に接続したテレビ端末の“コネクテッドTV”経由等）から、関連性があると推定した情報を統合して仮想ユーザーのIDを生成します。これにより、従来のクッキーを用いた配信のように、想定した見込み顧客への広告配信が可能になります。 3．Webサイト来訪ユーザーの属性を分析できる Webサイトにタグを設置して、Webサイト来訪ユーザーの情報を分析するとともに、IDごとに当てはまる「属性」を推定します。興味・関心等の複数の要素でユーザー像を分析することができます。 今後の展開 DNPは、本サービスの提供を進め、2025年までに累計30億円の売上を目指します。また、Lotame社とともに、クッキーに依存しない広告商材やWebサイト来訪ユーザー分析のほか、企業等が保有するファーストパーティーデータ強化のメニューを開発・提供していく予定です。DNPは、個人情報保護と企業等の広告活動を両立するデジタル広告ソリューションの開発・提供をさらに進め、本サービスのような“ポストクッキー商材”を含め、新しい顧客データ分析基盤の開発も検討していきます。 ＊1　Lotame社（https://www.lotame.com/）：本社・米国。顧客データ等に多様なデータを組み合わせる“データエンリッチメントソリューション”を世界中の企業に提供するグローバルリーディングカンパニー。 ＊2　株式会社ゲシェル（https://gesher.co.jp/）：海外スタートアップと日本企業の協業・連携支援を実施。Lotame社とは日本市場で協業しており、今回DNPにLotame社を紹介した。 ＊3 クッキーは、ユーザーの閲覧先サイトと異なる広告事業者（サードパーティー）のサーバーが発行して、ユーザーのPC等の中に作成するファイルです。ユーザーのプライバシー保護の観点で、このクッキーをブロックするWebブラウザーが増え、法律が整備されるなど規制が強化されています。

"834",":Article","2023年6月19日 竣工前の建築物をメタバースで構築して企業と生活者のコミュニケーションを活性化 リアルとバーチャルが連動した施設・空間を活用し、新しい働き方や体験を提供 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス XR コラボレーション 地域創生・まちづくり DX メタバース 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：北島義斉　以下：DNP）は、現実（リアル）の施設等の建築と並行して、建築用のデータを基に高精細なバーチャル空間「メタバース」を構築し、両空間の連動による企業と生活者のコミュニケーション等を支援するサービスを6月に開始します。新設する施設等を活用した各種展示会・株主総会・就職説明会・社内向けイベントなどを、リアルとバーチャルの両面でサポートしていきます。 現実（リアル）の施設（上）と仮想（メタバース）の施設（下） DNPは2021年から、リアルとバーチャルの空間を連動して、新しい生活者の体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーション®事業」を展開しています。また、安全・安心に楽しめるバーチャル空間を構築するXRロケーションシステム「PARALLEL SITE®（パラレルサイト）」を提供しており、今回その機能を拡充し、メタバースの企画から構築・運用までトータルに支援します。本サービスによって、完成前のリアル施設の一足早いバーチャルでの公開と体験、完成後の施設を遠方の顧客や社内外の関係者によるバーチャルの利用など、社員のエンゲージメント向上や顧客とのコミュニケーションの活性化につなげます。 【本サービス開発の背景とDNP社内での実績】 近年テレワークやワーケーションが広がり、働き方や暮らしの多様化によって、リアルな施設の利用方法や位置づけが大きく変化し、バーチャル空間でもリアルな施設と同様の体験や働き方をしたいというニーズが高まっています。こうしたニーズに対してDNPは、建築データを基にリアル施設と並行してメタバースを構築し、多様な企業コミュニケーションを支援するサービスを開発しました。 DNPは本社がある東京・市谷地区の再開発を進める中で、2022～2023年に自社ビルの建築データを活用してメタバースを構築し、「メタバース納会」や「社内向けイベント“未来づくりミーティング”」を開催しました。これらのイベントに参加した社員のアンケートからは、「約6割の社員が満足」「約7割の社員がポジティブな気持ちになれた」など、エンゲージメント向上やコミュニケーション活性化の成果が出ており、こうしたノウハウなども本サービスの開発に活用しています。 【本サービスの特長】 １．さまざまな建築データに基づくメタバースの構築が、最短2カ月から可能に DNPは、建築関連の3次元データに加え、各室の名称・面積、材料・部材の仕様などの属性情報をあわせ持つBuilding Information Modeling（BIM）データやCADデータ、3次元座標値・色情報で構成される「点群データ」など、さまざまな建築・設計データを基に、最短2カ月からメタバースを構築することが可能です。 ２．最大1,000名まで参加できる大型イベント等でも活用可能

"835",":Article","2023年6月19日 「サン・ジョルディの日」に社員同士で本を贈り合うイベントを実施 本との思いがけない出会いや、人と人とのコミュニケーションを創出 企業情報 人的資本 コラボレーション デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）は今年、本と出会う機会をつくる取り組みの一つとして、4月23日に定められている「サン・ジョルディの日」に、社員同士で本を贈り合うイベントを実施しました。 「サン・ジョルディの日」は、スペイン・カタルーニャ州の風習に基づいて、愛する人へ想いを伝える日、恋人・家族・友人などの親しい人に本や花を贈る日とされています。DNPは、日本においても「サン・ジョルディの日」を「本を楽しみ、親しい人と本を通してコミュニケーションする」きっかけにしたいという想いから、若手を中心とした社員の有志がプロジェクトを立ち上げ、本を贈り合う企画を実施しました。 実施内容 趣旨に賛同する約300人の社員が、「サン・ジョルディの日」に社員同士で本を贈り合いました。本を贈る人・贈られる人をそれぞれランダムに選び、参加者は会社が配布した図書カードで本を購入し、メッセージカードとともに相手に渡しました。 テレワークの広がりによってリアルに顔を合わせる機会などが減っている状況に対して、社員同士の交流の促進も目的としています。 実施後のアンケートでは、「本を選ぶ時間の豊かさを感じた」「自分では選ばない本と出会えて面白かった」「日常的に交流のない、年齢も離れた方に、自分に合うであろう本を選んでいただいたことがうれしかった」「贈った方の思わぬ一面に出会えた」「普段接点のない人と話す機会になった」など、本を贈り合う体験に喜びを感じ、本の魅力を再認識したという声が集まりました。本を贈る社員・贈られる社員をランダムに選ぶことで、面識のない相手と初めて交流することになった社員も多く、本を通じて生まれた新しいコミュニケーションを楽しんだ参加者が多かったことなどがわかりました。 若手社員（右）が事業部長（左）に本を贈る様子 ■「サン・ジョルディの日」を記念したDNPグループのその他の取り組み 「DNPプラザ」＊1（東京・市谷）にある外濠書店では、4月24日～6月12日に来店者参加型の「本を贈り合うコーナー」を設置しました。来店者が外濠書店で購入した本を「おすすめのコメント」を添えて専用ボックスに入れ、代わりに他の来店者がそのボックスに入れた本を持ち帰るという仕組みです。 DNPグループが運営する紙とデジタルのハイブリッド型総合書店「honto」では、「サン・ジョルディの日に贈りたい本」の展示・販売を実施しました。リアルの場である外濠書店とオンラインの「honto」の両方で、人と本との偶発的な出会いを生み出す取り組みを推進しました。 外濠書店の「本を贈り合うコーナー」 DNPグループが運営するアート関連の情報発信拠点・ショップである「メゾン・デ・ミュゼ・デュ・モンド（MMM）」＊2（東京・銀座）では、「大切な人に本を贈るキャンペーン」として、4月17日～22日に1,000円以上の本を購入した方に、画家ルドゥーテのバラを描いた作品のポストカードをプレゼントしました。 今後の展開 DNPは事業活動を通じて人々の心豊かな暮らしを実現していくことを目指し、芸術・文化と触れ合う機会の提供や新たな文化体験のビジネスモデル構築などに取り組んでいます。その一環で、自由で多様性に富んだ出版文化の醸成に向けて、本を読む動機や機会の創出に注力しており、今回の実証イベントの成果を活かして、グループ全体でこの取り組みを加速していきます。また、「サン・ジョルディの日」が新しい本との出会いや文化体験につながる日として浸透していくよう、出版業界や生活者にこうした活動を広げていきます。

近年、テレビなどディスプレーの大型化にともない、パネル・偏光板・フィルム等のディスプレー製品の面積拡大の需要は増加傾向にあります。英国の市場調査会社Omdia（オムディア）によると、テレビやPC等のモニターでは、2022～2026年の年平均成長率（CAGR）は5%、2022～2029年のCAGRは4％の面積増加が見込まれています。＊1また、65インチの大型テレビが主流になるなか、パネルや偏光板の中国メーカーが生産効率の向上に対応するために大型化に対応したラインを増強しており、2,500mm幅に対応したテレビ向け光学機能性フィルムのニーズが高まっています。 こうした動向に対してDNPは、生産した光学機能性フィルムから、65インチ用フィルムを効率良く取ることができる2,500mm幅対応のコーティング装置を2018年に偏光板向け保護用光学フィルム生産では世界で初めて導入＊2しています。今回この優位性をさらに活かすために、新たに三原工場に広幅コーティング装置を増設することになりました。 広幅ラインのイメージ また、今回増設した広幅コーティング装置は、同時に2層を塗工できる設計になっています。今後のディスプレーの高機能化、多様化にともない、多層のコーティングが必要となり、AG-LR（Anti-glare-LR）フィルムや反射防止（Low Reflection）フィルムなどの需要にも対応していきます。 LR製品の効果イメージ（左:従来のAGフィルム 右:高防眩AG-LRフィルムの比較） 液晶ディスプレーパネルの構成図 【増設する高機能光学フィルム生産ラインの特長】 新ラインで生産する2,500mmの広幅のフィルムは、世界的に需要が増加している65インチのディスプレー向けの光学機能性フィルムを効率良く生産（面付け）することができます。 光学機能性フィルムの反射防止の機能･性能を向上させる上で重要となる“多層コーティング”の生産性を考慮した設計になっています｡ 増設したコーティング装置は、消費電力を削減する新技術の導入や生産プロセスの革新によって、従来と比較して年間30％のCO2排出量の削減が見込めます。 増設したラインの設備投資額は、約130億円を予定しています。 【今後の展開】 DNPは、新たに増設した生産ラインによる量産を2025年度上期に開始する予定です。主に中国をはじめとする各国の偏光板メーカーにディスプレー向け光学機能性フィルムの提供を拡大し、2026年度で年間約1,100億円の売上を目指します。また、DNPは光学機能性フィルムに関して、国内外で多数の特許を保有しており、知的資産を最大限に活用して、今後さらに高まる高機能品の需要に対応していきます。 ＊1

"838",":Article","2023年6月8日 「XRコミュニケーション®」事業の推進に向けて newtrace と業務提携 世界大手のゲーミングメタバースプラットフォーム「Roblox」を活用したIPビジネスを開始 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス XR メタバース コンテンツビジネス コラボレーション 大日本印刷株式会社 newtrace株式会社 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）と、国・地方自治体、BtoBメーカー等のバーチャル空間やアバター制作を手掛けるnewtrace株式会社は2023年6月に、「XRコミュニケーション®」事業＊1の推進を目指して業務提携します。業務提携の一環として「Roblox」＊2を活用したサービスを提供します。 Robloxは、アバターを使ってユーザー同士が交流しながら思い思いに過ごすメタバース（仮想空間）の側面も持つグローバルプラットフォームで、約180の国・地域で2億人以上がプレイしており、1日あたり約6,620万人のアクティブユーザーがいます。  両社は今後、Roblox内の仮想世界である“ワールド”上で国内のIP（Intellectual Property：知的財産）コンテンツが楽しめる“ワールド・デジタルアイテム”を展開し、国内と海外のファンをつなぎます。また、IP関連の企業や多様な業種の企業のブランディングやマーケティング関連の活動に向け、“ワールド”の利活用や独自の“ワールド”を企画・運営するサービスを提供します。 左：Robloxで制作したワールドの例「日本浮世絵街道」、右：販売アイテムの例「キャラクターお面」 【本提携の背景と目的・ポイント】 管理者を必要としない分散型インターネットである次世代の「Web3.0」が期待される中、メタバース等において、アニメ・マンガ・ゲーム等のIPを活用したデジタルアイテムの需要も高まっています。また、若年層を中心に、ゲーム空間の中で自身のアバターのカスタマイズを楽しみ、ユーザー同士がコミュニケーションをする時間が増えています。  Robloxの国内パートナーであるnewtraceはCG制作技術と建築設計領域で培った空間演出力等の強みを有しています。DNPは、アニメ・マンガ・ゲーム等のIPホルダーとの関係が深く、リアルとバーチャル、モノづくりとサービスのハイブリッドな強みを有しています。両社はこうした強みを掛け合わせ、国際的にも主流となるゲーミングプラットフォーム上で、各種エンターテインメント企画の立案・運営やデジタルアイテムの提供・販売等を行っていきます。IPを活用した企業等の独自の“ワールド”やアイテムの提供を通じ、コンテンツとそのファン同士をグローバルにつないでいくことを目指します。 Robloxの活用によって、以下の三点のアプローチを可能にします。  両社が共同で企画・運営するオリジナル“ワールド”の提供と各種アイテムの販売  同“ワールド”内での企業マーケティングの展開（タイアップ広告・プロモーション等） 各IPの世界観などを体験できる独自の“ワールド”やアイテム等の開発・運営  【今後の展開】  今回の業務提携開始に当たり、両社共同企画によるデジタルアイテムの販売を開始します。newtraceが制作・公開している「日本浮世絵街道」で、DNPがプロデュースするキャラクターのアイテムを販売します（2023年6月8日から販売予定）。  今後も、さまざまなIPホルダーや企業と連携して、アニメ・マンガ・ゲーム等のコンテンツの世界観を反映した“ワールド”やアイテムを提供し、リアルな商品の展開も合わせた「XRコミュニケーション®」事業を推進して新しい価値を提供していきます。  ■会社概要  ○大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）について 独自の「P&I」（印刷と情報：Printing & Information）の強みとして、多彩な表現技術や、高度なセキュリティ環境で膨大な情報を安全・安心に処理するノウハウ等を有し、多様なパートナーと連携しながら、リアルとバーチャルの融合によって新しい体験価値を創出する「XRコミュニケーション®」事業を展開しています。その一環で、アニメ・マンガ・ゲーム等のIPホルダーと協業し、リアルとバーチャルの双方の空間でコンテンツの魅力を発信し、コンテンツとファンや企業等をつなぐ新しいコミュニケーションモデルの創出に取り組んでいます。

"840",":Article","2023年6月2日 メタバースで職業体験するワークショップを渋谷区「みらいの図書室」で実施 子どもたちの創造力を育み、職業への興味喚起にメタバースを活用 製品・サービス XR コラボレーション 次世代通信 DX メタバース 教育 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）と一般社団法人渋谷未来デザイン、宮下公園パートナーズ（東京都渋谷区立宮下公園の指定管理者）は、現実の宮下公園を高精細に表現した仮想（バーチャル）空間「渋谷区立宮下公園 Powered by PARALLEL SITE」＊1を構築し、公共空間の高度な利用に向けた実証事業を行っています。 今回、インターネットのバーチャル空間「メタバース」の展開の可能性を探るため、渋谷区の子どもたちを対象に、「メタバース職業体験プログラム」のワークショップを2023年5月10日（水）～11日（木）に実施しました。このワークショップは、渋谷未来デザインが公益財団法人日本財団の助成のもと行う、「子ども第三の居場所」＊2のコミュニティモデルとして開催しました。さまざまな環境の子どもたちが集まり、未来への関心や共感性、生き抜く力を高めることを目指す地域支援事業「みらいの図書室」の体験学習プログラムとしてDNPと渋谷未来デザインは協業しました。 メタバース職業体験プログラムのイメージ 【本ワークショップの背景と主な特長】 DNP・渋谷未来デザイン・宮下公園パートナーズの三者は、2021年にバーチャル空間「渋谷区立宮下公園 Powered by PARALLEL SITE」を構築して以来、謎解きイベントやアート展等のさまざまな企画を実施し、メタバースの利活用を推進しています。今回、教育分野でのメタバース利活用の可能性を検討するため、子どもたちが身近な“店員”の仕事を体験するワークショップを実施しました。メタバース上でのオリジナルストアづくりや接客体験を通じて、子どもたちの好奇心や創造性を育み、メタバースで新しい価値をつくる楽しさや接客・販売等の職業に対する興味の喚起を促しました。   メタバース職業体験プログラム（ワークショップ）の様子 【本ワークショップの実施概要と主な流れ】 今回のワークショップには、小学生15名が参加しました。1日目の5月10日（水）には、メタバース空間に自分が開設するオリジナルの店舗のデザインのほか、飲料のPETボトルやトートバッグなど、店舗に陳列する自分のオリジナル商品の制作などを行いました。2日目の5月11日（木）には、メタバース空間の店舗に什器を設置して、1日目に制作した商品を陳列し、子どもたち同士が店員役と顧客役を決めて、接客の体験を行いました。 子どもたちは積極的な様子でワークショップに参加しており、「オリジナルストアづくりが楽しかった」「もっと時間をかけて取り組みたかった」といった感想がありました。地域支援事業「みらいの図書室」の運営者からは、「メタバースのような最先端のデジタル技術に触れることができて、子どもたちにとって良い体験になった」という意見がありました。 【今後の展開】 DNPは、あらゆる年齢・性別・言語等の人々が、互いに分け隔てられることなく、リアルとバーチャルの双方を行き来できる新しい体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーションⓇ事業」を展開しています。今回のワークショップの結果を踏まえ、既存の教育サービスと組み合わせて、メタバース空間ならではの子ども向けプログラムの開発を検討するなど、地域や企業・団体の課題やニーズにあわせて多様なメタバースを提供していきます。

"842",":Article","2023年6月1日 「デジタルトランスフォーメーション銘柄（DX銘柄）2023」に選定 ビジネスモデルの変革に向けたDX戦略に基づく組織・人材・環境の整備が高く評価 ニュースリリース 企業情報 DX データ流通 メタバース デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京 代表取締役社長:北島義斉 以下:DNP）は、経済産業省と東京証券取引所が共同で、デジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）に積極的に取り組む企業を評価・公表する「DX銘柄2023」に選定されました。 「DX銘柄」は、東京証券取引所の上場企業の中から、企業価値の向上につながるDX推進の仕組みを社内に構築し、優れたデジタル活用の実績が表れている企業を選定するものです。2023年度は、32社が選定されました。 【DNPのDX戦略】 DNPはDXについて、事業ビジョンに掲げる「P&Iイノベーション」に基づき、独自の印刷（Printing）と情報（Information）の強みを掛け合わせて新しい価値を創造することであると位置づけています。デジタルとアナログ、リアルとバーチャル、モノづくりとサービス等のハイブリッドな強みを融合し、「人・モノ・体験」が連動するDNPならではの新しいビジネスモデルを生み出しています。 DX戦略として、「事業の推進」で、デジタルを活用した「新製品・新サービス創出」と「既存の製品・サービスへの新たな価値の付加」を、「基盤の強化」で、「社内システムの革新とICT人材・DX人材の育成・拡充」と「工場のスマート化による生産性の飛躍的な向上」を掲げ、価値の創出に取り組んでいます。 ○DX戦略推進に向けた組織・人材育成 社内特区として、自由度の高い環境でイノベーションを生み出す組織を設置し、DXによる新規事業の開発を推進しています。DX推進を支える人材育成にも努め、DX実現に重要なアジャイル開発やクラウドネイティブ開発、AI等の教育プログラムを充実させています。また、グループ全体で進めている事業構造改革や注力事業開発の体制を強化するため、ICT人材へのリスキリング（学び直し）を進めています。加えて、高度化するサイバー攻撃に対する社員の意識を高めるため、メールアドレスを持つ国内外のDNPグループ社員約3万人にサイバーセキュリティ教育プログラムを実施しています。 ○DX戦略実現のためのデジタル技術の活用と情報システムの構築 DNPは、印刷事業で培ったメディア変換・画像処理・言語処理・データ分析・情報セキュリティなどのコア技術に、AI・XR（Extended Reality）・クラウド・アジャイル・認証などの先端技術を掛け合わせて、リアルとデジタルを融合したビジネスプラットフォームを構築し、多様なサービスやソリューションを開発・提供しています。また、社内システムのICT基盤では、クラウドサービスの活用を第一候補とする“クラウド・バイ・デフォルト”を基本方針とし、生産から販売、間接業務までのあらゆる業務でクラウドサービスを積極的に採用しています。自社でサーバーや各種機器等を保有して運用する“オンプレミス”から、拡張性や柔軟性が高い“クラウド”に移行することでシステムの運用負荷を軽減し、ICT人材をはじめとする社内リソースを“攻めのIT”に集中させ、DXを通じた価値創出を加速させます。 【DNPのDX関連事業の例】 ①XRコミュニケーションⓇ事業 DNPは、多様な年齢・性・言語などの人々が、互いに分け隔てられることなく、リアルとバーチャルの双方を行き来できる新しい体験と経済圏を創出する「XRコミュニケーション事業」を展開しています。高精細・高品質な表現技術、安全・安心に大量の情報を処理する能力、リアルとバーチャルを融合するXR技術等のDNPの強みと、多くのパートナーの強みを掛け合わせて、多様な価値を創出しています。地域の自治体・パートナー企業等とともに街を創り上げる「地域共創型XRまちづくり」、アニメ・マンガ・ゲーム等の知的財産（IP：Intellectual Property）等のコンテンツを起点に生活者やクリエイターをつなぐ「コンテンツコミュニケーション」、メタバースを活用した企業の新しい情報発信やファンコミュニティ構築等の「マーケティング支援」などを展開しています。 ②リアルとバーチャルをつなぎ“新しい買い物体験”を実現する「ストアDX」 DNPは、メーカーや流通・小売等の企業のDXを支援し、生活者の接点となる「イエナカ（家中）／マチナカ（街中）／ミセナカ（店中）」の場面に応じて、リアルとデジタルの両面でコミュニケーションをシームレスにつなぐサービスを展開しています。DNPは、買い物に関する顧客の体験（Customer Experience：CX）の価値を最大化するため、個々の生活者に最適な情報を配信する「LINEチラシ」、店頭のIoT機器等を活用して来店頻度や店内の導線等をデータ化する「リテールマーケティングプラットフォーム」、流通・小売の戦略的な販促を支援する情報管理プラットフォーム「Retail Meister®」（リテールマイスター）等を組み合わせて、各種サービスを提供することで、「ストアDX」を実現します。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。 ※ニュースリリースに記載された製品の仕様、サービス内容などは発表日現在のものです。その後予告なしに変更されることがありますので、あらかじめご了承ください。

"844",":Article","2023年5月31日 大日本印刷　OpenXと協業し、企業のデジタル広告取引におけるカーボンニュートラルを支援 デジタル広告配信にともなうCO₂排出量を可視化、環境負荷の低い広告設計を提供 ニュースリリース 製品・サービス マーケティング・セールスプロモーション 環境 DX コンテンツビジネス 大日本印刷株式会社（本社：東京　代表取締役社長：北島義斉　以下：DNP）は、OpenX Technologies, Inc.＊1（以下：OpenX）と協業し、デジタル広告配信の過程で発生するCO₂排出量を計測し、DNP独自の広告取引経済圏「DNP Marketplace」＊2と組み合わせて、より環境負荷の低い広告設計を提案するサービスを2023年6月より順次開始します。 背景 デジタル広告の主流は現在、広告主の要望に応じて、リアルタイムかつ自動でインターネット上の広告枠を買い付けて表示するプログラマティック広告ですが、その過程において、データの処理やコンテンツの配信等で使用されるサーバーの稼働、膨大な通信量などでエネルギーを消費しており、温室効果ガス(GHG)排出につながっています。 特に日本では、広告の配信先やクリエイティブを多様化して広告効果を高める手法が好まれ、デジタル広告活動のGHG排出量は年々増加しています。一方、その際のGHG排出量の計測が難しく、関係者・広告主等にとって意識しづらかったため、要因の把握や削減方法などといった業界全体で対策が不十分でした。 こうした課題に対して、DNPは今回、デジタル広告取引のエネルギー消費量を計測するとともに、その量を削減し、最適化してCO₂削減を目指す広告設計を提案していきます。広告配信にともなう多様な工程やプレーヤーを見直して適切でシンプルな状態にするとともに、配信先媒体やクリエイティブを効果的に絞り込むなど、ブランディング型の広告設計に中長期的にシフトしていくことで、環境に配慮した持続可能な広告活動を実現します。  DNPが提供する環境配慮型デジタル広告サービスとその特長 ○ 　OpenXによるCO₂計測とレポート プログラマティック広告では、広告主のニーズを管理するプラットフォーム（DSP）と、媒体社のWebサイトと広告枠を管理するプラットフォーム（SSP）の間で広告取引が自動で行われます。今回DNPは、Net-Zero SSPプラットフォーム＊1であるOpenXが提供する「Green Media Product」と連携し、そこで発生する通信量に基づきCO₂の排出量を計測します。広告代理店やDSP側の設計に応じてSSPの通信量は増減するため、そこからサプライチェーン全体のCO₂排出量を想定して削減案を提案します。計測は、広告案件ごとに行い、毎月のレポート提供とともにCO₂削減に向けた顧客への継続的支援を実施します。DNPとOpenXはデジタル広告のCO₂排出量の計測および、それに基づく環境配慮型デジタル広告サービスを提供します。 ○	ターゲティング広告、クリエイティブの種類などの削減 個々のユーザー状況に応じて適切な広告を配信するターゲティング広告や、多様なパターンのクリエイティブ配信、同じユーザーへの同一広告の配信（フリークエンシー）などについて、その効果を見直し、年間で約10％程度削減します。 ○	PMP(Private Market Place)取引の活用拡大 PMP取引（効果の高い媒体社を優先的に選定して行う広告入札取引）は、通常の、オープンオークション（多様な広告媒体とリアルタイムに自動で行う広告入札取引）と比較して、大幅に通信量が削減できます。DNP独自のPMP取引「DNP Marketplace」の活用を促進することで、CO₂排出量を抑制するとともに、良質な潜在顧客獲得を支援します。 ○	炭素除去プロジェクトのクレジット購入（寄付）によるオフセット 削減しきれないCO₂に関しては、各企業・団体が行う炭素除去プロジェクトのカーボン・クレジット＊3を広告主が購入する取り組みで、カーボンニュートラルを目指す設計を提案します。 ○	「DNP Asia Kids Experience®」＊4プログラムの提供 国内・東南アジア小学校での出張授業を扱う「DNP　Asia Kids Experience®」を活用し、脱炭素社会の実現に向けた子どもたちへの啓発施策など、持続可能な企業活動の支援も可能です。 今後の展開 DNPは今後、本サービスの広告主への提供を拡大するとともに、第三者機関との連携により、サプライチェーンにおけるCO₂の計測ポイントを増やすなど、サービスを強化していきます。また、環境配慮型の広告設計によるCO₂削減と、広告主のコンバージョン率の両立に関する実証実験を行う予定です。DNPは、広告代理店や媒体社なども含めたさまざまなプレーヤーと協力し、デジタル広告のサプライチェーン全体でのカーボンニュートラル実現に向けた取り組みを推進していきます。 DNPグループは「DNPグループ環境ビジョン2050」を策定し、持続可能なより良い未来に向けた「脱炭素社会」の実現への取り組みを加速させています。製造におけるGHG排出量の削減とあわせて、マーケティング領域においてもその課題を強く意識し、製品サービスの開発を推進していきます。 *1　OpenXは、世界で最初の「Net-Zero SSPプラットフォーム」（SBTiターゲット：パリ協定に基づく温室効果ガス削減目標の設定に関する認証　に基づくネットゼロとして独立した検証を受けたSSPプラットフォーム）です。2018年を基準として炭素排出量を96％削減し、さらに、2年連続でカーボンニュートラル認証を取得しています。OpenXが提供するGreen Media Product(Green Media

"845",":Article","2023年5月31日 北米最大の建築関連展示会「Architecture Expo（A’23）」に出展 グローバルで実績がある高機能・高意匠の内外装材を展示 イベント 製品・サービス 生活空間 デザイン 環境 大日本印刷株式会社（DNP）とグループ会社のDNPアメリカ（DNP America, LLC）は、2023年6月8日（木）～9日（金）に米国・サンフランシスコで開催される北米最大の建築関連展示会「Architecture Expo（A’23）」に出展します。DNPブースでは、「Surfaces for future life standard」をコンセプトに掲げ、高い品質と信頼を実現する“技術”と、快適で豊かな空間を設計する“デザイン力”というDNPグループの強みを掛け合わせた各種製品・ソリューションを全世界からの来場者に提案します。 出展する「外装用化粧シート」 出展する「突板代替化粧シート」 【「Architecture Expo（A’23）」の概要と、DNPの生活空間関連の取り組みについて】 American Institute of Architects（AIA：アメリカ建築家協会）が主催する「A’23」は、年に1回開催される「AIA conference」と同時に開催される建築関連の展示会です。DNPはこの「A’23」に出展し、高い専門性を持つ建築家やデザイナー、住宅設備や建築資材のメーカー等の来場者に対して、国内外で多くの実績を持つ内装材・外装材を訴求します。 DNPは独自の「P&I」（Printing & Information：印刷と情報）の強みを掛け合わせ、環境・社会・経済のサステナビリティ（持続可能性）と人々のウェルビーイング（心豊かな暮らし・生き方）に貢献する価値を創出し続ける総合印刷会社です。今回、電子線（Electron Beam）を活用する独自のEBテクノロジーによって各種機能を高めた「外装用化粧シート」と、木目等を印刷したシート（紙・塩ビ）の上から塗装できる突板代替化粧シートをDNPブースで訴求します。EBテクノロジーは、フィルム等の基材に薄く均一にコーティングした各種機能性材料をEBの照射で瞬時に硬化させ、耐候性・耐傷性等の機能を付与する技術です。 会期 2023年6月8日（木）～9日（金） 会場 米国・サンフランシスコ Moscone Center（747 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94103） DNPブース ホール：North and South Buildings Halls A-F　ブース番号：5535 【DNPブースでの主な出展内容と製品の特長】 １．EBテクノロジーで各種機能を高めた「外装用化粧シート」 建築物のドア・窓枠・ルーバー等の外装に使用する装飾フィルムです。木材等の柄に対して質感をエンボス加工できるため、多彩なデザインバリエーションを演出できます。EBテクノロジーや耐候剤の配合などにより、紫外線による風化や色・デザインの退色を防ぐなど、耐久性を高めています。また、シックハウス症候群の原因とされる化学物質のホルムアルデヒド、トルエン、キシレンなど（厚生労働省の指針対象物13VOC）の排出量が低い製品です。 ２．木目等を印刷したシートに後から塗装できる「突板代替化粧シート」 突板代替化粧シートは、木材資源の枯渇による流通の不安定化や価格の高騰という課題に対し、環境保護・供給不安解消の観点から、これまで家具・建具・窓枠等に使用していた突板（木材を薄くスライスした化粧材）の代替品となる、アフター塗装が可能な化粧シートです。ベースとなる材料に紙または塩ビを使用した2種類の製品があり、用途や加工形状に合わせて使い分けできます。 【今後の展開】 DNPはこれまで、家具・室内建具用化粧シート等の内装材を中心に、北米のインテリア関連企業等に向けて多くの実績を重ねてきました。今後はさらに、独自の技術と高いデザイン力を活かし、外装材にも力を入れて、快適で豊かな空間づくりに貢献していきます。

"846",":Article","2023年5月30日 DNPグループ社員3万人に向けて「生成AI」の利用環境を構築 積極的なDX推進の一環で生成AIの利用も促進し、新しい価値を創出 ニュースリリース サステナビリティ 情報セキュリティ データ流通 認証・セキュリティ DX デザイン 大日本印刷株式会社（本社:東京 代表取締役社長:北島義斉 以下:DNP）は、デジタルトランスフォーメーション（DX）推進の一環として、国内外のDNPグループ約3万人＊１が生成AI（Generative AI）を業務で利用できる環境と体制を構築し、2023年5月31日に運用を開始します。 DNPは、日本マイクロソフト株式会社が提供する「Azure OpenAI Service＊2」上でChatGPT＊3を利用することで、社内で使用したデータを自社内に留め、情報漏えいを防ぐ高セキュリティな環境で運用します。 DNPの生成AIの利用イメージ 【DNPの生成AIの利用背景】 文章や画像等を対話形式で自動生成するAIは急激に進化しており、仕事や暮らしを大きく変えると言われています。そうした状況に対してDNPは、DX推進の一環として生成AIを業務に積極的に活用し、新しい価値の創出を加速させていきます。 DNPが進めるDXは、事業ビジョンである「P&Iイノベーション」に基づき、印刷と情報（Printing & Information）の独自の強みを掛け合わせ、「事業の推進」と「基盤の強化」によって新しい価値を創出することだと位置づけています。今回DNPは、生成AIの運用開始によって、「基盤の強化」をさらに推進するとともに、今後は「事業の推進」にも展開して、生活者や企業等に新しい価値を開発・提供していきます。 「オールDNP」で推進する「DXによる価値創造」 【DNPグループにおける生成AIの活用について】 対象となる国内外のDNPグループ社員は、イントラネットでアクセスすることで、いつでも生成AIを業務で活用することができます。技術・営業・企画・製造など、さまざまな部門や職種の社員が積極的かつ効率的に活用できるよう、社員向けの相談窓口の設置や社内勉強会の実施なども行っていきます。 これまでも、最大限にAIを活かすため、適切な質問や指示（プロンプト）を作成し、AIから得られる回答や提案の品質を向上させる「プロンプトエンジニアリング」や、生成AIを活用したサービスの可能性などをテーマに200名以上が参加した「社内研修」、アイデア・サービス創出のための「ハッカソン」などを実施しており、今後も継続していきます。 【今後の展開】 DNPは、多様な強みを持った社員全員が新しい価値創出の源泉であると位置づけて、人的資本の強化に向けた「人への投資」を加速させています。その中で、専門的な強みを持ったICT人材・DX人材の強化にも注力しています。 そうした中で生成AIについては、社内での利用から開始し、その後は社外に向けた事業としても活用していきます。2023年度にスタートした新中期経営計画で、「注力事業領域」の一つに位置付けた「コンテンツ・XRコミュニケーション関連事業」をはじめ、さまざまな事業領域で生成AIの活用を促進します。最先端の生成AIを活かしたDNP独自の次世代コミュニケーション支援技術の開発などを通じて、生活者や企業・団体等に新しい価値を提供していきます。 ＊1　国内外の36,246名（2023年3月末時点）のDNPグループ社員のうち、メールアドレスの保有者を対象とします。 ＊2　マイクロソフト社のクラウドサービス「Azure」の申請許可制のサービスとして利用します。 ＊3　米国OpenAI社が2022年11月に公開。大規模言語モデルの一種である生成AI「GPT（Generative Pre-trained Transformer）」の機能を人間との対話向けに強化した対話型AIです。 ※記載されている会社名・商品名は、各社の商標または登録商標です。
